MOSCOW — Often castigated by the United States over its record on human rights, democracy and civil liberties, Russia on Thursday seized on the Senate Intelligence Committee report on the use of torture by the C.I.A. to turn the tables on Washington and demand that those responsible be brought to justice.

The Russian government, in a statement posted on the Foreign Ministry’s website, said the report provided “confirmation of gross, systemic human rights violations by the American authorities.”

The statement, issued by Konstantin Dolgov, the ministry’s commissioner for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, called the disclosures in the report “shocking” and complained that only the executive summary had been released, while the bulk “remains classified, and the American authorities still do not wish to disclose it.”
