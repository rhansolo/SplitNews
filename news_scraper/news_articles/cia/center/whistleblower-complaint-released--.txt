On Thursday, The House Intelligence Committee released the official 9-page whistleblower complaint that has led to an official impeachment inquiry of President Trump.

In the complaint, the whistleblower provides substantial new details about the circumstances of the phone call in which Trump encouraged Ukrainian President Zelenskiy to help investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son.

The whistleblower accuses the Trump administration of a wide-ranging cover-up regarding Trump’s interactions with Ukraine. According to the complaint, White House officials took numerous steps to lock down information about the phone call, even moving the transcript to a secret computer system.

In the aftermath of the call, according to the whistleblower, White House lawyers were concerned “they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain,” the complaint says.
