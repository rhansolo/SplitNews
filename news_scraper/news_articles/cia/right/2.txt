The CIA is pushing back against news reports that it pulled a U.S. asset from Moscow two years ago because of President Donald Trump, calling the story "simply false."

It was reported Monday that a Russian who had been working inside the Kremlin with access to Russian President Vladimir Putin is now living in Washington, D.C., under U.S. protection. The person was evacuated from Russia by the CIA, according to the report, after the agency believed Trump divulged too much classified information to the Russians and may have put the person's life in jeopardy.

"CNN's narrative that the Central Intelligence Agency makes life-or-death decisions based on anything other than objective analysis and sound collection is simply false," CIA director of public affairs Brittany Bramell said. "Misguided speculation that the president's handling of our nation's most sensitive intelligence — which he has access to each and every day — drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate."

NBC News reported later Monday that five minutes after a reporter knocked on the door of what's believed to be the person's residence in the Washington, D.C. area, two men in an SUV came racing up the street and asked the reporter what he was doing at the home.

The New York Times claimed that the Russian played a key role in informing the U.S. government about Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
