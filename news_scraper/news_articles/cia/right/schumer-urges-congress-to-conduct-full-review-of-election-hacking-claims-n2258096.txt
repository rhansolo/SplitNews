Newly elected Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has said that the new CIA report that claims Russia propelled Donald Trump to the presidency via hacking schemes is "stunning" but not surprising. He is now urging Congress to order a full review of the potential hack and its impact on the vote.

In his statement, Schumer said the idea that any country “could be meddling in our elections should shake both political parties to their core.” He added that silence from WikiLeaks and others has been “deafening.” “Senate Democrats will join with our Republican colleagues next year to demand a congressional investigation and hearings to get to the bottom of this,” Schumer said. “It's imperative that our intelligence community turns over any relevant information so that Congress can conduct a full investigation.”

President-elect Donald Trump and his transition team have dismissed the CIA's conclusions and continue to insist his victory was achieved fair and square. On CNN Saturday morning, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer sparred with Michael Smerconish, insisting that the committee's system proves they had not been hacked.

Nevertheless, President Obama ordered a full review of the hacking claims on Friday.
