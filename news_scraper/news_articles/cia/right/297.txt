The CIA needs to be held accountable for the "awful" interrogation procedures that were detailed in a report released Tuesday by Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, Sen. Dick Durbin told MSNBC's "Morning Joe."Feinstein, a California Democrat, unveiled details of the 6,000-page report, which critics immediately blasted as a partisan effort that could embolden enemies and imperil American lives abroad.Durbin, the Democratic Party's Majority Whip in the Senate, said the CIA needed a complete review, in light of new details about the agency's interrogation program."I think what's happened in the CIA over the last 10, 15 years has really been awful," the Illinois Democrat said Thursday. "This report ... really makes it clear that the CIA needs to be completely reviewed, in terms of their leadership and in terms of, frankly, their responsibility for accountability."Durbin was quick to show support for the "people in our military and our intelligence agencies for keeping America safe," suggesting it was a "rogue operation within the CIA" that was responsible for the interrogation program.Durbin said he hadn't "reached that point yet" of calling for the resignation of CIA Director John Brennan, adding he was waiting to see the agency's "response to this damning report."Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has been highly critical of the report, was "wrong" for suggesting the "real fault's with the Senate Intelligence Committee," Durbin said."The fault is people at the top who were looking the other way, even when they were informed," Durbin said. "This great agency needs to be accountable."
