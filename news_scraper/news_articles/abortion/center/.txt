Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzTrade groups make lobbying push to be included in small business loan program Republicans take aim at Google in fight to remove legal shield Roberts sparks backlash from conservative senators with DACA ruling MORE (R-Texas) took aim at legislation recently introduced in Alabama by a state representative that would, if passed, make it mandatory for certain men to get vasectomies — a bill that comes in response to legislation passed last year that seeks to ban abortion in the state.

“Yikes,” Cruz wrote in response to the bill on Twitter on Sunday morning. “A government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take everything...literally!”

Yikes. A government big enough to give you everything is big enough to take everything...literally! Alabama Democrat proposes bill mandating all men have vasectomy at age 50 or after third child. https://t.co/PeaNUg1Joc — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 16, 2020

Cruz was referring to legislation introduced by Alabama state Rep. Rolanda Hollis (D) last week that would, if passed, require men to get vasectomies if they are over the age of 50 or have had at least three biological children.

Cruz’s tweet, which has racked up over 14,000 likes in hours, received even more comments from critics who felt his response proved Hollis’s point behind the measure.

Yes, the government shouldn’t be involved in private reproductive health choices, yes, that’s a great point you made, yes. — Kevin M. Kruse (@KevinMKruse) February 16, 2020

Yes. Governments have no business controlling the reproductive systems of citizens. Glad you've finally come around on choice, Senator.

“Under existing law, there are no restrictions on the reproductive rights of men,” a synopsis for Hollis's bill states. "This bill would require a man to undergo a vasectomy within one month of his 50th birthday or the birth of his third biological child, whichever comes first."

In an interview with AL.com last week, Hollis said that the legislation comes in response to a law passed in the state last year that seeks to make abortion illegal in almost all case, including in instances of rape or incest. The bill has not yet taken effect after being blocked in court.

“The vasectomy bill is to help with the reproductive system, and yes, it is to neutralize the abortion ban bill ... it always takes two to tango," she told the outlet.

“We can’t put all the responsibility on women. Men need to be responsible also,” she also said.
