President Trump and first lady Melania Trump took a hand-in-hand stroll Monday through the well-manicured grounds and along a reflecting pool of the famed Taj Mahal in India.

On their flight to Agra during the president’s first official visit to the country, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he’d never been to the iconic 17th-century mausoleum, but that he’s heard it’s “incredible.”

Larger-than-life-size cutouts of Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeted the president along the route from the airport as crowds waved tiny Indian and American flags.

They arrived at the UNESCO world heritage site just as the sun was beginning to set.

The first couple held hands in front of the iconic symbol of lasting love before walking back toward the mausoleum.

“It’s truly incredible,” Trump said. The first lady described the Taj Mahal as “lovely” and “beautiful.”

“Do you want to do a press conference now?” the president jokingly asked reporters, CNN reported.

Noticeably absent were the hordes of rhesus monkeys that roam the site and that local police were prepared to shoo away if they posed a threat to the commander-in-chief.

Earlier, the president was greeted and cheered by a raucous crowd of more than 100,000 people inside a huge cricket stadium.
