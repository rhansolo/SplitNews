President Donald Trump's trip to India and the potential for a trade deal "changes the course of history going forward," House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Monday.

"With what Indian-Americans have contributed to our society and others, this just creates a much bigger bond," the California Republican told Fox News' "Fox and Friends." "For the president to do this and build with [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi, this makes the world stronger."

Earlier on Monday, Trump was cheered by over 100,000 people at the opening of the world's largest cricket stadium, after which he and first lady Melania Trump toured the Taj Mahal with Modi. A state dinner is planned for later in the day.

McCarthy said he has found that foreign leaders have a great deal of respect for Trump and that many more respect him now than did past presidents because of where the United States is under his leadership.

Meanwhile, McCarthy talked about Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Democrats' frontrunner in the 2020 race, and said he believes the party will lose its House leadership because of the growing embrace of socialism from many on the left.

"This is really a Bernie Sanders party," said McCarthy. "This is not the Democratic Party of the past. This is the socialist Democratic Party that thinks Fidel Castro is a good person," he added, referring to comments Sanders made about the late Cuban dictator over the weekend.
