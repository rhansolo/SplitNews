(CNN) A top Tom Steyer aide apologized Thursday after a report said he allegedly offered money in exchange for endorsements of his boss from Iowa politicians.

Aide Pat Murphy, the former speaker of the Iowa House, apologized "for any miscommunication on my part" in a statement provided by the Steyer campaign to CNN, after The Associated Press reported the alleged financial offers.

"As a former legislator, I know how tricky the endorsement process can be for folks in Iowa," Murphy said in the statement. "It was never my intention to make my former colleagues uncomfortable, and I apologize for any miscommunication on my part."

Steyer's campaign said the billionaire Democratic candidate did not make any individual contributions to political candidates in Iowa this year and will not be making any.

"The endorsements he receives are earned because of Tom's campaign message, his decade-long work taking on big corporations who put profits over people, and his work registering and organizing voters across the country to support progressive causes," the campaign said in a statement provided to CNN.
