More significant is that with the advantage of incumbency and the ability to fund-raise for the past three years, the Republicans are beginning the general election with about $255 million in cash on hand. As of late last month, Mr. Trump and the R.N.C. had nearly $187 million more in the bank than Mr. Biden and the D.N.C. The president’s re-election campaign is already embracing that edge by unleashing a $10 million ad blitz aimed at attacking Mr. Biden.

Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager, and Ronna McDaniel, the national committee chairwoman, said the numbers showed enthusiasm and support for Mr. Trump.

Mr. Biden and the D.N.C. started a joint fund-raising agreement at the end of April, after he became his party’s presumptive presidential nominee.

“The money disadvantage is real, and it hurts, but to win you don’t have to equal Trump in fund-raising,” said Jim Margolis, a veteran Democratic strategist, addressing the broader cash imbalance. “You just need to be able to communicate, organize and compete in the seven or eight states that will determine the election.”

The April number is the product of a full month of fund-raising virtually, after the coronavirus crisis shut down traditional campaigning in March, just as Mr. Biden was emerging as the likely nominee.
