The Democratic National Committee has $8.7 million on hand and $7 million in debt, according to its October Federal Election Commission campaign finance report.

The DNC's fundraising figures are likely to be a fraction of what Republicans have raised as President Trump seeks reelection. The Republican National Committee told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday that it has $61.4 million on hand and $0 in debt.

The RNC raised $25.3 million in October, nearly three times as much as the Democrats who raised $9 million. Furthermore the RNC has raised $194 million in 2019 so far with the DNC raising less than half of that, at $75.5 million.

Sean Spicer, Trump's former White House press secretary, also weighed in on the DNC's latest numbers.

Embarrassing. The DNC is effectively bankrupt which is huge problem for the eventual nominee https://t.co/O5R1dp3p39 â€” Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) November 21, 2019

A joint fundraising effort between the Trump campaign and the RNC has raised over $300 million in 2019 so far. Last month it reported having over $156 million in the bank.

The DNC dropped this report during the middle of the 10-candidate Democratic debate, with candidates trying to one-up each other on how they would challenge Trump in 2020.
