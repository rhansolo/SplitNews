Thompson declined to say how or when Cummings communicated his plan to the committee, which organizations will receive money, or whether any funds could be directed for purposes not tied to youths. Such committees are permitted to pay staff salaries and other expenses. Cummings’ widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said it would be premature to comment on the leftover funds, and the committee’s political director, Carla Farrington, said the campaign had “no further comment on this matter.”
