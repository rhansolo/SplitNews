The amendment would allow Congress and states to put limits on campaign contributions, according to a statement from Schiff's office.

"The Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United overturned decades of legal precedent and has enabled billions in dark money to pour into our elections," Schiff said in a statement.

The amendment would also allow states to enact laws creating public financing of campaigns.

"Amending the Constitution is an extraordinary step, but it is the only way to safeguard our democratic process against the threat of unrestrained and anonymous spending by wealthy individuals and corporations," he added. "This amendment will restore power to everyday citizens."

Schiff also announced the amendment on Twitter.

"Our democracy is not for sale," he wrote. "We must stop the flood of dark money from drowning out the voices of everyday citizens."
