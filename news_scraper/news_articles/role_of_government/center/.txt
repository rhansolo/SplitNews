Scriberr’s co-founder and field reporter, Kalen D’Almeida, was attacked on June 14 while reporting in Seattle’s Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) at approximately 1:50 a.m. The zone had been named a “police-free” occupation, and footage captured by D’Almeida showed the various aspects of its community coming together to support one another.

While CHAZ remained relatively peaceful during the day and reports of a “festival-like” vibe permeated the six-block zone, a select number of groups lurked the streets after sunset. According to D’Almeida, a few of these groups were ANTIFA, John Brown Gun Club, and alleged “warlord” rapper Raz Simone and his followers.

“I was sitting on a couch 40 yards away filming Raz Simone in case anything interesting happened while he was out,” D’Almeida said. There had been multiple reports the previous nights of Simone patrolling the zone with a gun harnessed on his leg.

While Simone insisted his purpose was a peaceful protest and nothing else, multiple scuffles occurred within his group that was settled through force.

The President really put a hit on my head. I’m not a Terrorist Warlord. Quit spreading that false narrative. The world has NEVER been ready for a strong black man. We have been peaceful and nothing else. If I die don’t let it be in vain. pic.twitter.com/HSEs5C2QRv — Raz Simone (@RazSimone) June 11, 2020

According to D’Almeida and multiple field reporters on the scene, a few of Simone’s friends huddled in a circle looking at something on a cell phone. When they spotted D’Almeida, they began stalking him.

“Give me your phone, show me what’s on your phone, or I’m going to knock you the f*ck out,” one man said to D’Almeida.

D’Almeida decided to move away from the area, when another agitator grabbed him by the collar of his jacket and punched him in the back of his head. Soon, he found himself surrounded by more agitators so he ran outside of the zone’s barriers to seek help. He recalled yelling for people to help him get out of the area, but no one did.

Even after D’Almedia escaped CHAZ and alerted Seattle authorities, agitators followed him in a midnight-blue Toyota Camry with all-tinted windows. He said the angry mob wanted him to give up his phone and equipment and report to a “medical tent for interrogation.”

Finally, he was able to be escorted back to his hotel by officers in the Seattle Police Department.

I spoke w/@FromKalen, who was assaulted after recording in the “CHAZ.” He says Raz Simone’s crew hit him & tried to forcibly detain him in the “medical tent” for an interrogation. They wanted him to turn over his phone. He escaped the zone, found a hiding spot & called police. — Andy Ngô (@MrAndyNgo) June 15, 2020

D’Almeida interviewed a number of CHAZ-goers, asking them what their message and purpose was to reside in the zone. All counters were peaceful and individuals were willing to chat with him. D’Almedia live-streamed a majority of the encounters and posted them to both his personal Twitter account and Scriberr’s social media accounts. He said his only intent was to share their message and report what he saw.
