The majority of Americans said they oppose changing the name of military bases carrying the names of Confederate leaders, while another majority said they are against reparations for slavery in a new poll.

Key results in the ABC News/Ipsos survey:

56% are against renaming military bases that currently bear the name of Confederate leaders. Party-wise, 71% of Democrats support changing the names, while 13% of Republicans and 40% of independents do.

73% said they oppose the federal government paying black Americans whose ancestors were slaves. 54% of Democrats are in favor of reparations, while 94% of Republicans and 82% of independents are against the practice.

63% said they support a ban on police officers using chokeholds.

The aforementioned issues have boiled over in recent weeks following high-profile killings of African Americans by police officers. Nationwide protests, some of which have turned violent, are calling for changes to American society.

The poll was conducted June 17-18 among 727 adults. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.
