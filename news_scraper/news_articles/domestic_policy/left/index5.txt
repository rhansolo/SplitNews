Story highlights "Congress has completely abdicated their responsibility," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said

Officials said Wednesday there have been 64 confirmed cases of Zika in pregnant women in the continental U.S.

Washington (CNN) The White House on Wednesday issued a dire warning to Republicans in Congress: Spend money to prevent the Zika virus from spreading within the United States or regret it later.

"Congress has completely abdicated their responsibility," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, speaking of its inaction on the Obama administration's request for nearly $2 billion to take extensive preventative measures, such as developing vaccines and widespread mosquito control.

"I take no joy in suggesting that Republicans are going to look back on this time that they've had to act on the Zika virus and deeply regret it," Earnest added.

The White House slammed members of Congress over the administration's decision to shift more than half a billion dollars that was designated for fighting Ebola to instead be used against Zika.
