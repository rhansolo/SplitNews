Brad Parscale, President Donald Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign manager, announced Monday that all attendees at Saturday’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma will receive a temperature check, hand sanitizer and a mask before gaining admission to minimize the chances of spreading or contracting coronavirus.

Parscale tweeted that the campaign has received more than one million ticket requests for the rally, the first rally Trump and the campaign have hosted since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued social distancing recommendations in mid March.

Over 1M ticket requests for the @realDonaldTrump #MAGA Rally in Tulsa on Saturday. Before entering each guest will get: Temperature check

Hand sanitizer

Mask There will be precautions for the heat and bottled water as well. — Brad Parscale (@parscale) June 15, 2020

He added that the campaign will take “precautions for the heat and bottled water as well.”

Reported cases of coronavirus in Tulsa County reached a record high June 9, according to the Tulsa County Health Department.

The media has speculated how exactly the rebooted rallies will comply with local social distancing and coronavirus mitigation guidelines, especially considering the president and Republican National Committee’s decision to move parts of the 2020 convention out of Charlotte, North Carolina.

Trump tweeted late Friday night that the rally, originally scheduled to be held on June 19, would instead be held on Saturday. The president was criticized for scheduling the event on Juneteenth, the anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the United States.

“Many of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out of respect for this Holiday, and in observance of this important occasion and all that it represents,” POTUS tweeted. “I have therefore decided to move our rally to Saturday, June 20th, in order to honor their requests.”
