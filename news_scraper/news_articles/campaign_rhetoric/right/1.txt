Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) can add another endorsement to the top of his list.

The Working Families Party, a progressive group that originally endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), is now switching its support to Sanders.

In an announcement on Twitter, the group said, “WFP supporters nationwide are mobilizing to help Bernie win so we can defeat Trump and build an America that works for the many, not the few.”

BREAKING: We’re endorsing @BernieSanders for president!

Sanders responded to the endorsement in a tweet saying, “I thank the [Working Families Party] for their support.”

“Together, we’re going to build a multiracial, multigenerational grassroots movement to sweep Donald Trump out of the White House and transform this country so it works for all of us.”

The endorsement comes just a few days after Warren dropped out of the presidential race as IJR previously reported. The former presidential hopeful still has yet to make an endorsement.

In response to Warren’s departure, the Working Families Party tweeted, “It has been an honor to be a part of this fight with Elizabeth. But while her presidential campaign may be over, the fight for her vision of big, structural change continues.”

Sanders is currently lacking in endorsements from other former presidential hopefuls as they several have endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden. Among those include former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas). More recently, Biden garnered support from Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Ca.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) as IJR previously reported.

Sanders is currently trailing Biden on the delegate count. The Michigan primary is slated for Tuesday which is crucial as Sanders will need to gather more delegates in order to save his presidential bid. The candidates are set to vie for a total of 125 Michigan delegates.
