The Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina quickly degenerated into a schoolyard screaming match Tuesday night — all of the candidates furiously talking over each other as the CBS moderators seemed unable to do anything about it.

CBS News moderators Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell struggled to keep the seven unruly candidates in line as six of them rushed to attack Bernie Sanders, who they now realize is on an unstoppable march to the nomination.

At one point, all of the candidates were wildly flapping their hands and yelling over each other before former veep Joe Biden chastised their on-stage decorum.

“I guess the only way to do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should,” Biden said as ex-South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg went on a long sermon about how Sanders would cost Democrats the House majority, a statistic based on polling conducted by Michael Bloomberg’s campaign.

Showing more fire than he has in many debates, Biden shot back when Buttigieg and other candidates tried to cut him off after King had specifically called on him to speak.

“You spoke over your time so I’m going to talk,” the former veep bellowed at the rest of the crowded field, to huge cheers from the crowd.

Biden is in a fight for his life in South Carolina ahead of Saturday’s primary, with Sanders and billionaire Tom Steyer swallowing his lead among black voters.
