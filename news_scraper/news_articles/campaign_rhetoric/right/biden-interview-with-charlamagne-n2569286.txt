During an interview with radio host Charlamagne, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said that if black voters don’t support him for president they aren’t really black.

The comment came after a staffer interrupted the conversation, trying to cut off the interview.

An irritated Biden then said, “If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black."

"It don't have nothing to do with Trump, it has to do with the fact -- I want something for my community,” the host responded.

Listen to the audio.@JoeBiden: "If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black."



Biden thinks he can dictate what makes people Black or not. https://t.co/aRBRPQcGXA — Tim Murtaugh - Download the Trump 2020 app today! (@TimMurtaugh) May 22, 2020

At another point in the interview a staffer cut in again while the 1994 Crime Bill was being discussed.

Sounds like Joe Biden's staff actively tried to protect him from having to answer tough questions about his 1994 Crime Bill, during an interview with Charlamagne tha God.
