Primaries and caucuses are both methods state parties use to choose their nominees for public office — including president of the United States. But while they generally lead to the same result, distinguishing between the two is essential — especially for those of us in Iowa.

The video above explains the differences between primaries and caucuses, taking a closer look at Iowa's Democratic caucus to demonstrate how the process works.

New Hampshire, which will hold its 2020 primary on Tuesday, Feb. 11, eight days after Iowa's caucuses, is the "first-in-the-nation primary state."

How do the Democratic and Republican caucuses work in Iowa?

If Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucus system became too similar to a primary, New Hampshire could, by New Hampshire state law, leapfrog us in line, becoming the first state in the nation to weigh in on the presidential race.
