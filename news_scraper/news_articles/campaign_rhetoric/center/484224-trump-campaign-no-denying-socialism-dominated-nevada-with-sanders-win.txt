Sanders cemented his status as the front-runner in the race on Saturday after he was projected to win the third nominating contest by Saturday evening Eastern time.

Early returns showed the progressive senator dominating among young people and Latinos in Nevada and winning several downtown Las Vegas caucus sites, which tend to be dominated by the labor union rank and file.

Sanders's front-runner status has alarmed centrist and establishment Democrats who warn he will not be able to defeat Trump in a head-to-head match-up and could have a negative impact on down-ballot Democrats facing uphill reelection battles.
