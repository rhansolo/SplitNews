President Trump on Friday celebrated an unexpected decline in the unemployment rate in May with an appearance at the White House, where he also talked about “tremendous progress” made on a vaccine for Covid-19 and the nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd.

“George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing that is happening for our country,” Mr. Trump said, an assertion that, as fact checkers say, lacked evidence. “A great day for him, it’s a great day for everybody.”

Here is a fact check of some of his other statements.

What Was Said

“Nobody has ever done for the black community what President Trump has done.”

False. Even assuming that Mr. Trump was just comparing himself to other presidents and not abolitionists and civil rights leaders, experts said his claim was profoundly ahistoric.
