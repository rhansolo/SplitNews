House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cheered the Senate's passage of the $2 trillion stimulus bill that aims to give the nation's economy a boost amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Shortly after the bill passed 96-0 Wednesday night, Pelosi released a statement regarding the "bipartisan legislation" and credited Senate Democrats for improving the original text written by Republicans.

"America is facing a grave health crisis with a serious impact on our economy," Pelosi said. "I salute the strong leadership of Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats. I especially thank our House Democratic Committee chairmen, who worked hard to move the Republican proposal from corporations-focused to workers-first and who will now review the legislative text of this agreement with our caucus."

After calling the GOP's stimulus proposal "a non-starter," Pelosi said the final bill text brought together both sides the aisle.

"This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people," she said.

"While the compromise does not go as far as our Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act, thanks to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has moved a great deal closer to America's workers."

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said before the Senate's vote that the Democrat-controlled House will take up the 883-page bill Friday morning.

Among other things, the bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child.
