The Fed is “committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time even as we recognize that these actions are only a part of a broader public-sector response,” he said in prepared remarks.

The Fed has already gotten several lending programs not backed by congressional money fully set up, but of the five that use funding from the March stimulus law, known as the CARES Act, only one is partially running. The rest are in various design phases as officials try to make sure they can get credit to companies and local governments that need it without violating the law or risking excessive losses.

When asked why they are not pushing further with Congress’s appropriation, Fed officials have consistently pointed to the Treasury.

“I do think we’re clearly moving into areas where there is more risk than there has been in the past,” Mr. Powell said at his April news conference. “But in terms of the way to think about that money, I think that’s really a question for the Treasury Department.”

The Fed and Treasury have sometimes clashed over the details of program design, with some at the central bank pushing for greater risk-taking, though they have agreed on the overall purpose and on which sectors, be it the municipal loan market or corporate credit, need a program.

The Treasury has pushed back on the idea that it is being too cautious. Mr. Mnuchin thinks that if the Fed were to take on more risk, it would insist on having even more financial backing. He has been holding about half of the funds in reserve as he assesses the economic effects of the programs rolled out so far — and keeping some powder dry in case the downturn becomes more dire.

In testimony prepared for delivery on Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said Treasury had “committed up to $195 billion in credit support under the CARES Act. We have the remaining $259 billion to create or expand programs as needed, as we continue to monitor a variety of economic sectors closely.”
