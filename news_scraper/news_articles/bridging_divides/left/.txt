People across the LGBTQIA+ spectrum came to the VICE offices in Brooklyn to hash out some of the most pressing issues they face today. This is part 2 of that conversation.



Within the LGBTQ umbrella lies a multitude of identities and ideologies. In an effort to showcase this VICE gathers a diverse group of progressive and conservative members of the LGBTQ community to discuss topics that relate to queerness and its intersection with culture, and politics.



Our goal is to foster conversations that are already happening within communities. With this format, we hope to give the viewer a rare opportunity to witness a conversation with people across the aisle that they otherwise might never find themselves in.



TIMECODES OF WHAT WAS DISCUSSED:

00:29 - does Pete Buttigieg being gay make you want to vote for him?

2:08 - Identity Politics (things get heated)

3:20 - Pete Buttigieg as representation for LGBTQ+ people

3:55 - How do people feel about the terms GNC ("gender non-conforming") and "non-binary?"

11:08 - do you feel welcomed by the LGBTQ+ community?

14:29 - The Gender Binary
