President Trump working with Democrats this month may have upset some Republicans but American voters largely viewed the move positively.

According to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday, more than 70 percent of Americans approve of the deal Trump made with Democratic leadership to temporarily fund the government and raise the debt ceiling.

His approval rating also rose to 43 percent—3 points higher than it was in August. This increase is within the margin of error, however. Fifty-two percent of respondents disapprove of the job he’s doing.

Divided along party lines, 83 percent of Republicans approve of Trump’s job performance, compared to just 10 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of independents. These numbers are all up from August, when 80 percent of Republicans approved of his performance compared to 8 percent of Democrats and 21 percent of independents.

"Going to the middle has helped him with the middle — without costing him much from his own base," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang.

Asked about Trump’s accomplishments in office, a combined 33 percent think he’s accomplished either a "great deal" or "a fair amount." By contrast, 66 percent of Americans believe he’s accomplished "only some" or "very little" as president. Even only a third of self-described Trump voters — 34 percent — say the president has accomplished a "great deal." (NBC)

The poll of 900 adults was conducted from September 14-18 and has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.
