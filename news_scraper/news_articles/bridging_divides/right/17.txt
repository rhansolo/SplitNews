Conservative radio host and vocal Donald Trump critic Glenn Beck vowed Wednesday to reach out to the president-elect and do whatever he can to support him.

“I am reaching out today. I will call him today,” Mr. Beck said on his radio show, according to his website The Blaze. “Whether he takes my call — and I’m not saying he’s gonna shun it, I mean, he’s now the president-elect so he’s a little busy.

“If I don’t get a hold of him I will write a letter, and I will even post the letter so you can read it,” he said. “He has our support as I’ve said from the beginning: We will give whoever is president our support. That would have gone for Hillary Clinton as well. I won’t sell out my values, but I will support you. We cannot have a failed presidency.”

“So whatever we can do to help him, as long as we’re staying constitutional, we’re there,” he added.

Mr. Beck has repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump as “immoral,” “depraved,” and “unhinged.” In August, he told his radio listeners that he believed Mr. Trump was “a dictator in the making,” The Blaze reported.

Mr. Trump, for his part, has called Mr. Beck “irrelevant,” “wacko” and “a real nut job,” The Blaze reported.
