Which leaves the lead-out slot to bring us together. The timeslot has less power than it once did, too, but something about the special character of “The Masked Singer” suggests to me it’ll be fine. The last truly notable post-Super Bowl broadcast was “This Is Us,” which promoted that it was going to kill off its central character and unleash a vale of tears. By contrast, “The Masked Singer’s” value proposition is relatively innocent: Tune in, have some laughs, let the dumb parts give you something to talk about, tune out, go to bed having been distracted and diverted for a while. It’s one of the core functions of TV throughout its history, and one increasingly less central to the medium, whether for reasons of lofty ambition or of circumstances intruding on once-uniting entertainments like the NFL. Either way, “The Masked Singer” promises to end the Super Bowl festivities on a note of uplift -- even if it’s the first of the night.
