Something helped hold us together as a nation in 1968. Time and again, it was sports.

The two teams that met in the World Series that season — the Detroit Tigers and St. Louis Cardinals — had such stars as Al Kaline and Willie Horton, and Curt Flood and Bob Gibson. They not only excelled between the lines but also took major roles in their communities.

Horton grew up in the Detroit Jeffries Projects, only blocks away from where the worst riots since the Civil War had occurred in late July 1967, a harbinger for the “long, hot summer” to follow. Horton hurried to the scene as soon as the Tigers game was over, still dressed in his uniform. There, Horton climbed atop the hood of a car and pleaded for people to stop, to go home. Unfortunately, not enough listened. Those five days of turmoil resulted in 43 dead and 7,231 arrested.

“People like to talk about courage, throw that word around,” Denny McLain, Horton’s teammate, told me. “But that’s one of the bravest things I ever heard about.”

Integrating athletes

A generation ago, the gestures and decisions that held us together were large and small, and they were often found in sports. When the Tigers began their drive to the pennant in 1968, police soon realized that a people gathering on the streets weren’t necessarily looking for trouble. More often than not in 1968, they were clustered around someone with a transistor radio, listening to Detroit’s Ernie Harwell call the play-by-play, as the Tigers rallied 40 times in the seventh inning or later that season.

That same summer, in a different sport, Joe Namath made sure his New York Jets didn’t divide along racial lines. Sports Illustrated writer Paul Zimmerman observed that the charismatic quarterback usually sat with black teammates at the team training table, “and then a few white players joined him, and soon it becomes a mixed table. I’ve seen this happen too many times (with Namath) to assume it’s accidental.”

That’s perhaps the saving grace about sports. The games may be a diversion, but they also remind us of what can be accomplished when we come together as a people. The best teams invariably find a way to move past what can divide them and focus on a common goal. The Cardinals, Tigers, Jets and so many other champions have followed that example.

“We want you up,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently told sports teams in his state. “We want people to be able to watch sports. … It gives people something to do. It’s a return to normalcy.”

MLB players and owners

Despite such enthusiasm, any chance for an abbreviated season in Major League Baseball will soon end unless the players’ union and owners can solve two riddles: health assurances and payroll concerns.

The NFL appears ready to return sometime this fall, depending upon any pandemic spike. Yet some haven’t forgotten the game’s treatment of another charismatic quarterback, Colin Kaepernick. His protest — that of taking a knee — seems tame with what’s playing out in the nation now.

A different take:Sports can be the great healer, but we're not there yet

Elsewhere, more athletes are becoming involved and trying to lead. But they will have to go some to fill the footsteps from 1968. At least “50 star athletes, former athletes and coaches” supported Robert Kennedy’s presidential campaign that year, according to The New York Times, and their ranks included Hank Aaron, Bill Russell, Gale Sayers and Vince Lombardi.

Some contend that big money has irreparably altered our relationship between professional athletes and their fans. The salaries have soared so high, sports stars don’t live in our neighborhoods anymore. Indeed, in 1968, some players had to find second jobs in the off-season to make ends meet. Many served in the National Guard, such as Mickey Lolich and Nolan Ryan, while the Vietnam War raged.

Still, there is something about an epic sports game or performance that alleviates, even unites us. A half-century ago, pitcher Bob Gibson realized that “there was no escaping the pervasive realities of 1968 — the assassination, the cities burning, the social revolution.”

The Cardinals’ ace pitched his first shutout of the season the same day as Robert Kennedy’s assassination. While Gibson couldn’t decide whether that tragic event, which occurred two months after Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, “got me going or not. Without a doubt, it was an angry point in American history for black people — Dr. King’s killing jolted me; Kennedy’s infuriated me.”

Gibson would go on to post a 1.12 ERA for the season, a record in the live-ball era. Those who saw him take the mound in such tumultuous times, and the courage and conviction he exhibited, will never forget it.
