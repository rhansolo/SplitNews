Most Americans, concerned about a resurgence of the coronavirus, are reluctant to return to their pre-pandemic activities despite several states starting to reopen their businesses and public spaces, according to a new poll from ABC News and The Washington Post.

The survey found that more than three-quarters of Americans say the pandemic has disrupted their lives, with over half saying that it’s had a severe economic effect on their community, and that controlling the spread of the coronavirus is more important that starting the economy.

79% say their lives were disrupted by the pandemic.

59% say the pandemic had a severe impact on their community.

57% say that controlling the spread of the virus is more important than reopening the economy.

58% say it’s too early to go to stores, restaurants and public places like they did before the outbreak.

63% remain somewhat or very worried about themselves or someone in their family catching the coronavirus.

68% are worried about a second wave of infections.

The survey found that white Americans were much less likely to worry about themselves or someone in their family contracting the coronavirus compared to black and Hispanic Americans.

58% of whites said they were worried.

75% of blacks said they were worried.

81% of Hispanics said they were worried.

Republicans, at 67%, and men, at 50%, were the most likely to say they would be willing to resume shopping in stores and going to restaurants and other public places. Democrats, at 18%, and women, at 31%, were much less likely to say they would go out to these places at this time.

Langer Research Associates produced the poll on behalf of ABC News. It surveyed 1,001 American adults by phone from May 25-28, with a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points.
