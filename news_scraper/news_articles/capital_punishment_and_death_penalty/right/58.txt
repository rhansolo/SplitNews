Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said Friday that the death penalty sentence for Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was “ineffective.”

While the likely Democratic presidential candidate said that he “respects the verdict of the jury” and said his prayers go to the victims and their loved ones, he used the occasion to make another statement on his opposition to the death penalty.

“The death penalty is ineffective as a deterrent, and the appeals process is expensive and cruel to the surviving family members,” Mr. O’Malley said, Mediaite reported Friday.

Mr. O’Malley added that “the vast majority of public executions” happen in the U.S., North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and China, and said that was a list the U.S. should not be on, Mediaite reported.
