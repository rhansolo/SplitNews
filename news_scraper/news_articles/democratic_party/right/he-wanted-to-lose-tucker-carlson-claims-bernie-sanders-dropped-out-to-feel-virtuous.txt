Fox News host Tucker Carlson says independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign because he "never wanted to win."

During Carlson's Wednesday night monologue, the host said Sanders's suspended campaign was structured to push the Democratic Party further to the left, later asserting he "wanted to lose" to feel "virtuous."

"That's it for Sanders," Carlson said. "He's 78 years old. He will never be the president, but he did leave his mark. For two cycles in a row, Bernie Sanders evoked panic at the highest levels of the DNC. Twice in a row, Democratic Party leaders managed to crush him in the end, and they did that despite the fact that Sanders had a large and passionate following, as well as a genuinely populist message."

"So, how did they manage to beat him twice?" Carlson asked. "Well, they couldn't have managed to do it without Sanders's help. Sanders never wanted to win; like so many ideologues, he wanted to lose. It makes him feel virtuous." Carlson then cited instances when Sanders refused to attack Democratic Party leadership.

"If the Democratic Party isn't bad enough for Sanders to attack it, then why do we need a revolution? Sanders never answered that question, and now he never will, because underneath it all, he was a party man to the core," Carlson concluded.

Sanders announced Wednesday he would drop out of the 2020 presidential race but insisted he would remain on future primary ballots and "continue to gather delegates."
