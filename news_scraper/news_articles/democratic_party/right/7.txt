Georgia Democrat Vernon Jones said Thursday that the way his party has treated him since he endorsed President Donald Trump is proof that “they are the bigots they claim to hate.”

“The way the Democrat Party has treated me this past week has made one thing clear: they are the bigots they claim to hate and I won’t be silent about it,” Jones tweeted along with a video of local news coverage of his resignation from the state House.

Jones received immediate backlash from within his own party after he announced his support for Trump, saying that the president had done great things for the black community. (RELATED: Georgia Democrat Becomes First To Endorse Trump, Credits His Work For Black Community)

“I’m a Georgia State Representative and lifelong Democrat. But in this election, I’ll be casting my vote for @realdonaldtrump,” Jones tweeted just last week, adding, “I didn’t leave the Democratic Party. The Party left me.”

Jones’ resignation was officially effective Wednesday.

Earlier today, I made the decision to not seek re-election to the Georgia House of Representatives. I look forward, however, to continuing to serve my community in other ways and doing all I can to re-elect @realDonaldTrump.

“I’m sick and tired of me and my family being attacked and harassed by the Democrat Party for putting my country before my party,” Jones said in a statement released Wednesday and first obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
