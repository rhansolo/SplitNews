Biden and Sanders last traded barbs in their first one-on-one debate of the primary cycle on March 15, and it is unclear whether there will be another such forum before the start of the general election campaign.

Despite hints that he would withdraw from the Democratic nominating contest soon after falling to Biden in the latest round of state primaries last week, Sanders has defied party pressure and remained in the race — which has been transformed by the coronavirus’ rapid spread across the country.

Campaign staff have begun working from home, several states have postponed primary voting, and pre-scheduled rallies and town halls have been scrapped en masse. Even the fate of the Democratic convention in Milwaukee this summer is up in the air amid the public health crisis.

Meanwhile, Biden and Sanders have sought to adapt to new methods of connecting with supporters as their campaign organizations rely increasingly on digital resources.

“I’m learning a lot more about how to get the message out, in terms of beyond what we’re doing,” Biden said on Wednesday, adding that there is still “plenty of opportunity to communicate” with the American people.
