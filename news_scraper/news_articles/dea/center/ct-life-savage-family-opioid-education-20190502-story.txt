While there are still unanswered questions as to exactly what happened the night of the graduation party, the Savages said their sons were offered and took oxycodone there. Two teens were eventually charged with bringing drugs and alcohol to the party, but not in connection with the Savage brothers’ deaths. Kyle Treber faced felony charges of distributing narcotics but eventually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of a narcotic drug and was sentenced to 90 days of jail time and probation, according to court records. Lauren Schwindaman was convicted of providing alcohol to minors — a misdemeanor — and sentenced to probation, records state.
