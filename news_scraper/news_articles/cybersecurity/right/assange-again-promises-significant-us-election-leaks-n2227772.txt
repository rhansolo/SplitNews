Tuesday’s highly anticipated announcement from WikiLeaks was not exactly the end of Clinton’s campaign as Roger Stone had hoped, but rather a discussion about the past, present, and future of WikiLeaks for its 10-year anniversary.

Julian Assange said they would be releasing roughly 1 million documents with “significant” information about the U.S. election, Google, and mass surveillance, among other topics, but he denied that the release would be focused on destroying Hillary Clinton.

"There's been a lot of misquoting of me and WikiLeaks publications,” he said. “In this particular case, the misquoting has to do with 'we intend to harm Hillary Clinton' or I intend to harm Hillary Clinton or I don't like Hillary Clinton. All those are false."

He also declined to say whether any of the upcoming releases would be directly related to Republicans.

The releases can be expected by the end of the year, with items dropping in the coming week.

Assange also said the nature of the organization and its funding would be changing, as it will soon open itself up to membership.
