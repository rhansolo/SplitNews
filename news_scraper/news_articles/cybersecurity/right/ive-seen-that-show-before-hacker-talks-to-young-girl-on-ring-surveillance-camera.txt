A Nebraska family was left upset and furious after a hacker managed to gain access to their Ring security system and speak to their young daughter.

"Very scary thing to report... someone hacked into our interior ring cameras and was watching us live this morning for 6 mins. A man started talking to my husband and daughter," Karley Krcilek said Tuesday on Facebook. "Change your passwords everyone and check your recordings for extended live views. Will be reporting to authorities today. It happened at 5:17am this morning."

Krcilek shared the video, which showed the family's kitchen through video footage recorded on Ring. A voice can be heard trying to talk to the couple's daughter. "What are you watching? Hey, what show is that? I’ve seen that show before. What season are you on?" the voice said before the girl's father entered the room.

"What are you eating? You hungry?" the voice asked the father, Adam Krcilek, who then approached the camera, asking, "Who is this?" He then turned the camera off.

The father spoke out about the incident, saying he was "upset" about the incident and now plans to take "down all my interior Ring cameras."

The company said the camera was not hacked but that he did not take the necessary steps to secure the cameras. "Unfortunately, when people reuse the same username and password on multiple services, it’s possible for bad actors to gain access to many accounts," the company said. "We will continue to introduce additional security features to keep your Ring account and devices secure."

A similar Ring security breach happened recently when a hacker compromised a system and used it to harass a biracial family, hurling racial slurs and insults over the speaker.
