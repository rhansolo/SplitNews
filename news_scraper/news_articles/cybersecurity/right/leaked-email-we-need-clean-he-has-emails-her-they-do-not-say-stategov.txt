Newly released emails published by Wikileaks show Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign admitting President Obama knew about Clinton’s use of a private email address during her time as Secretary of State, despite Obama saying he did not know about it until he saw it on the news.

In an email titled "POTUS on HRC emails" dated March 7, 2015, Clinton national spokesperson Josh Schwerin wrote:

Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news.

The email included a tweet from BuzzFeed News political editor Katherine Miller stating, “I have some questions here," in reference to Obama saying he learned about Clinton's private email use at “the same time everyone else learned it.”

Cheryl Mills, an aide to Clinton, replied to the email to Clinton national chairman John Podesta by saying “we need to clean this up,” confirming Obama received emails from Clinton that were not state.gov emails.
