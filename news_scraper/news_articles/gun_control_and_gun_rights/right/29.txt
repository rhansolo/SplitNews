Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., on Friday released a video of himself taking a rifle off the wall of his congressional office and challenging former Vice President Joe Biden to “come and take it.”

Buck made the video after Biden appeared with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke at a rally in Dallas on Monday, and said that the two of them will “take care of the gun problem.” O’Rourke said at one of the Democratic presidential debates in September that he would “take your AR-15, your AK-47.”

Buck wrote in a tweet: “I have just one message for Joe Biden and Beto O’Rourke, if you want to take everyone’s AR-15s, why don’t you swing by my office in Washington, D.C. and start with this one?”

He adds, “Come and take it.”

The congressman included a video of himself in his office repeating the message in the tweet while removing a rifle from its mount on the wall and holding it.

Although Washington D.C. has banned the AR-15 under its strict gun laws, Capitol Police say that "members of Congress may maintain firearms within the confines of their office and they and any employee or agent of any member of Congress may transport within the Capitol Grounds firearms unloaded and securely wrapped,” according to The Hill.
