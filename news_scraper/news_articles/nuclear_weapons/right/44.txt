Seoul (AFP) – North Korea said it was willing to abandon its nuclear weapons if the security of its regime is guaranteed, Seoul’s envoy said Tuesday after meeting with the North’s leader Kim Jong Un.

“The North made clear its willingness for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and made clear that there is no reason to own nuclear (programmes) if military threats towards the North are cleared and the security of its regime is guaranteed,” said Chung Eui-yong, national security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
