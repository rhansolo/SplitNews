President Trump doubled down on his attack on so-called “fake news,” suggesting the possibility of revoking licenses for “partisan” network news outlets.

“Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!” Trump tweeted Wednesday night.

That was Trump’s second tweet on the subject. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump floated the idea of challenging the license for NBC News after the network reported that the Republican had called for increasing the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal ten-fold.

Trump blasted the report, tweeting: “With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!”

Despite Trump’s rhetoric, any attempt to take NBC News or other networks off the air would be nearly impossible. That’s because only local affiliates of the major news networks have licenses. NBC, CBS, ABC and other networks do not operate with licenses.
