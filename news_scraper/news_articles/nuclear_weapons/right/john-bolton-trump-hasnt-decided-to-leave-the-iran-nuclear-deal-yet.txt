National security adviser John Bolton said Sunday President Trump still hasn't decided whether to leave the Iran nuclear deal ahead of his May 12 deadline.

"He is certainly considering the framework, the four pillars that [French President Emmanuel Macron] laid out in their meetings last week," Bolton said during an interview with "Fox News Sunday."

"And that I think is something that is of interest to the president and worth pursuing, but in terms specifically of the nuclear deal, there's no decision on that yet," he continued.

But Bolton added there was still some hope for European partners looking to convince Trump to amend the agreement rather than simply walk away from it.

"He's certainly said very negative things about the deal, which implied that these other steps wouldn't really address that concern, but it's possible in the discussions with our European allies that we will be able to see some possibility there," Bolton said.
