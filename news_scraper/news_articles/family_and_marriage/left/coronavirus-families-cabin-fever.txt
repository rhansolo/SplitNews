Anita Tandon and Sujit Chakravarthy, parents of three young children, ages 3 months to 7 years old, have taken extreme measures to keep order in their home during quarantine.

“At 9 o’clock, school’s in session and I stop being ‘Mommy,’” said Ms. Tandon, who runs a marketing advisory firm in Burlingame, Calif. “They have to call me ‘Teacher Anita.’ They can’t just goof off like they can with Mom and Dad.”

There are worksheets, activities, Khan Academy online courses and writing games. Around 5 p.m., Teacher Anita retires to work. Mr. Chakravarthy takes over, springing out of his home office ready for P.E. He goes by Coach Chakravarthy.

“It’s Day 3 of God knows how many,” Ms. Tandon said wearily.

It has been just over a week since Americans started to be ordered to stay at home and out of the way of the coronavirus pandemic. For many people, it already feels like an eternity.
