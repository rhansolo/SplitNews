Survey after survey shows bipartisan public support for school choice policies, notably among families with the most at stake in our education system. And while some fellow educators and I may still have reservations about nontraditional choice ideas, we have a responsibility to listen to what many families and communities are saying.

According to a survey of likely 2020 voters, Democrats for Education Reform (DFER) found that 81% of voters — including 81% of Democratic primary voters and 89% of black Democratic primary voters — support expanding “access to more choices and options within the public school system, including magnet schools, career academies and public charter schools.”

A recent EdChoice public opinion survey found that 78% of Democrats agreed with 78% of Republicans and 77% of independents in favoring education savings accounts, which let families access money usually funneled to school districts to spend on education-related expenses for their child. Current school parents were 85% in favor of ESAs, as were 78% of African Americans and 79% of Hispanic respondents.

And when EdChoice asked questions about school vouchers, which allow families to choose any type of school for their child using taxpayer dollars, Republicans were 68% in favor, followed by independents at 62% and Democrats at 59%. Parents favored vouchers at a 72% clip, as did African Americans. Hispanics were at 73%.

These are not slim majorities.

Special interests drown out families

Neither state I served this past decade had voucher programs — historically, they are a third rail among elected officials. There are justifiable concerns and sensitivities around funding and public/private legalities, but often vouchers aren’t discussed simply because the loud voices of special interest groups drown out the voices of families.

Community voices should at least prompt piloting of new approaches for the families who need it most. The unintended consequences merit caution, sure, but the intended consequence of putting families — particularly those from low-income backgrounds — in the driver’s seat are compelling.

After all, thanks to property taxes and redlining, families with financial means already have abundant school choice in ways that other families do not. If a wealthy family does not like its local school, it can choose a private school or move to a new school district. “Real estate choice” remains the primary form of school choice in America today.

The public understands how unjust this is, even if many politicos don’t want to acknowledge it. Given that students and families of color historically have been on the bad end of the deal, it’s no surprise that they overwhelmingly favor school choice policies.

Working families are out front on big, structural change for our education systems while political will and policy imagination are lagging.

As the former Education secretary for a Republican governor in New Mexico and as an associate secretary for six years under a Democratic governor in Delaware, I’m familiar with the polemics of both parties. But more important, I have visited dozens of rural, urban and suburban schools and school systems this past decade that look nothing like the ones from my childhood. From modern school design to individualized course plans, from world language immersion to high-quality career and technical training, child-focused education is what families are craving and what leading schools and school systems now offer.

In Albuquerque, I witnessed high-performing schools that embraced new models. Explore Academy, a public charter secondary school, provides students with nearly a thousand different course choices.

Another, Mission Achievement and Success, has achieved 100% graduation with the vast majority of its students from low-income backgrounds. It is a community school with wrap-around services, a high-expectations philosophy and two teachers in each classroom. In 2018, it became the first school to replicate (open a second campus) based upon academic performance.

Accountability is part of the equation

While it’s great to praise straight-A schools like these, it’s a half-measure if we’re unwilling to sanction once-promising options that do not meet expectations. The public agrees that consequences are necessary — they live in the real world. DFER’s survey also showed that 85% of voters were for tougher accountability rules.

Six charter schools shuttered during my tenure in New Mexico, and we brought greater accountability (and resources) to low-performing traditional public schools as well. School choice without academic accountability and oversight is a bad recipe for kids.

Whatever their political party, candidates with bold stances on school choice, innovation, accountability and measurement who understand how families talk at the kitchen table, places of worship and community centers will find a receptive audience as well as a source of support. It requires significant grassroots outreach, but respondents on these surveys are voters and families who represent children in our school systems. If we want to start a real revolution in education, we should listen to them.
