CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. â€” SpaceX has begun a new chapter in the history of United States spaceflight.

Elon Musk's private space company on Saturday launched NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley into orbit, successfully beginning SpaceX's first crewed mission. The company's Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon spacecraft took off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 3:22 p.m. ET. The capsule is the first privately designed and built spacecraft to carry astronauts to space and is bound for the International Space Station.

Beyond the achievement for SpaceX, the launch represents the first time NASA has launched its own astronauts since the end of the space shuttle program nearly a decade ago.

"It was incredible," NASA astronaut Bob Behnken said of the launch, moments after the spacecraft reached orbit. "Appreciate all the hard work and thanks for the great ride to space."

Known as Demo-2, the launch represents the culmination of SpaceX's work thus far. Musk founded the company in 2002 and has since declared its informal credo to be "making humanity a multi-planetary species." To date, SpaceX has launched dozens of satellites and spacecraft but, before Saturday, it had never put a human in space.
