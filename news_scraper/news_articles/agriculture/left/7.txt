In an article, WholeFoods Magazine wrote, “‘Hemp hero,’ ‘Cannabis champion,’ ‘climate villain’… U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been called all this and more. Odds are, you have an opinion about the Republican senator from Kentucky, and regardless of whether that opinion is positive or not, one thing is certain: Mitch McConnell has done a tremendous amount to influence the natural products industry in 2019, and what he has set in motion will continue to impact this industry for a long time to come.”
