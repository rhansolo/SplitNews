LOS ANGELES — California water regulators cracked down Monday on a rural irrigation district accused of illegally diverting water in the midst of the state’s drought emergency, proposing a record $1.5 million fine in what they said would be the first of many penalties like this.

The civil penalty filed against the Byron Bethany Irrigation District, which provides water to farmers in a 45-square-mile area in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, signals what state officials said would be an aggressive enforcement action directed at water providers that defy cutbacks ordered by the State Water Resources Control Board. It is the first time the state has invoked tough financial penalties, adopted into law last year, that kick in during a drought emergency.

California is in the fourth year of a crippling drought. In June, the state imposed a 25 percent mandatory cutback in urban water use, and has followed that up with a series of orders cutting off water to major agricultural interests, including farmers with water rights going back nearly a century. The Byron Bethany district fell into that category.

The irrigation district has 20 days to request a hearing. Officials with the district, which last month filed a lawsuit challenging the authority of the state water board to cut its allocations, said Monday that they would ask for a hearing and challenge the fine in court.
