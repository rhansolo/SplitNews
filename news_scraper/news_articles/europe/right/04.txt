President Trump waved at dozens of protesters Saturday while golfing at his club in Scotland, while thousands of demonstrators marched against him in the Scottish city of Edinburgh.

Protesters along the fairways at the Trump golf club in Turnberry chanted “No Trump, No KKK, No Racist USA” as the president played nearby, guarded by lines of police officers.

The president is spending the weekend at his Scottish golf resort before departing late Sunday for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday in Helsinki, Finland. On Friday, Mr. Trump held meetings with British Prime Minister Theresa May and met Queen Elizabeth II for the first time at Windsor Castle.

“I have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings, calls and hopefully, some golf — my primary form of exercise!” Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday. “The weather is beautiful, and this place is incredible! Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin.”

Just as Mr. Trump and his family entered the resort on Friday night, a paragliding protester breached a no-fly zone, coming close to the hotel. The aircraft, reportedly arranged by Greenpeace, bore a banner reading, “Trump: well below par #resist”.

Police said they are trying to locate the individual involved.

In Edinburgh, several thousand demonstrators including anti-fascist groups and activists took to the streets for the third day in a row to protest Mr. Trump’s visit to the United Kingdom.
