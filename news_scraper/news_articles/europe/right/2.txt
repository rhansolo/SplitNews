President Donald Trump early Monday on Twitter railed about the "trade deficits and losses" coming from European countries that refuse to pay the costs for defending their countries.

"Just returned from France where much was accomplished in my meetings with World Leaders," he tweeted. "Never easy bringing up the fact that the U.S. must be treated fairly, which it hasnâ€™t, on both Military and Trade. We pay for LARGE portions of other countries military protection ... hundreds of billions of dollars, for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade. I told them that this situation cannot continue - It is, and always has been, ridiculously unfair to the United States."

He continued that "massive amounts" of money is "spent on protecting other countries, and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses. It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves...and Trade must be made FREE and FAIR!"

Trump was criticized on Saturday when he canceled a planned trip by helicopter to a cemetery in Northern France where U.S. soldiers are buried, citing the rainy weather. White House chief of staff John Kelly and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff instead made the trip by motorcade.
