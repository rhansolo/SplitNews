Two top doctors in Italy claim the coronavirus has virtually disappeared in their hard-hit country.

"The swabs that were performed over the last 10 days showed a viral load in quantitative terms that was absolutely infinitesimal compared to the ones carried out a month or two months ago," said Alberto Zangrillo, who leads a hospital in Milan, Business Insider reported.

"In reality, the virus clinically no longer exists in Italy," he added. Zangrillo also urged Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to continue reopening the country.

"We've got to get back to being a normal country," he said. "Someone has to take responsibility for terrorizing the country."

A doctor who heads an infectious disease clinic in Genoa echoed Zangrilloâ€™s sentiments on the matter.

"The strength the virus had two months ago is not the same strength it has today," Matteo Bassetti told Italian media.

One health official in the country urged caution, saying there is no scientific proof the virus is no longer in the country.

"Pending scientific evidence to support the thesis that the virus has disappeared ... I would invite those who say they are sure of it not to confuse Italians," Sandra Zampa said.

The coronavirus hit Italy harder than many other countries in Europe, with 232,997 confirmed cases and 33,415 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker.
