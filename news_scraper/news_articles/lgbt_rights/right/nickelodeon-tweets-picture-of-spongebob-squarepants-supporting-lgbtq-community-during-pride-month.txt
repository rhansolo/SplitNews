SpongeBob is pictured with two characters who identify as LGBTQ. Michael D. Cohen from "Henry Danger," reportedly transitioned from female to male and Avatar Korra from "The Legend of Korra," who identifies as bisexual, according to WCIV-TV.

The show's creator, Stephen Hillenburg denied concerns over the sexuality of Spongebob and his friend Patrick Starfish citing that the characters were asexual.

"It doesn't have anything to do with what we're trying to do," Hillenburg told People Magazine in 2005. "We never intended them to be gay. I consider them to be almost asexual. We're just trying to be funny and this has got nothing to do with the show."

Children have been watching the misadventures of Spongebob Squarepants since 1999, following the sea sponge who works at a fast-food restaurant and lives in an underwater pineapple.
