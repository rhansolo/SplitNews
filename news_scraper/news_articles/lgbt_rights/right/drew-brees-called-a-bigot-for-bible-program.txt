NFL superstar quarterback Drew Brees was broadsided by the LGBT lobby over his support of an innocuous program advocating for children to bring their Bibles to school and live their Christian faith out publicly.

Brees has been outspoken about his Christian faith and how it has guided his life.

In the video promotion he recorded for the program, Brees talked about one of his favorite Bible scriptures, and encouraged kids to talk about their Christian faith.

"I want to encourage you to live out your faith on Bring Your Bible to School Day, and share God's love with friends," Brees said. "You're not alone."



Allies of the LGBTQ agenda excoriated Brees on social media.

Robert Littal of Black Sports Online called the group "a known racist discriminatory religious cult," and, "an Anti-Gay Religious Cult That Believes in Conversion Therapy & Fights Against Any Anti-Discrimination Laws."

Deadspin ran the headline "Drew Brees appears in video for gay conversion therapy sickos, doesn't understand what the big deal is," for the story.

Others on Twitter accused Brees of being a "bigot" and aligned with a "hateful group."

Brees responded to the online furor through a video on his Instagram trying to clear the air and saying that he was falsely smeared by a deceptive article on the story.

Brees said that he lived by the credo to "love all, respect all, and accept all."

"What I did was I filmed a video recently that was encouraging kids to bring their Bibles to school for national Bring your Bible to School Day," said Brees.

"So I'm not sure why the negativity spread, or why people tried to rope me into certain negativity," he added. "I do not support any groups that discriminate, or that have their own agendas that are trying to promote inequality. OK? So hopefully that has set the record straight, and we can all move on, because that is not what I stand for."
