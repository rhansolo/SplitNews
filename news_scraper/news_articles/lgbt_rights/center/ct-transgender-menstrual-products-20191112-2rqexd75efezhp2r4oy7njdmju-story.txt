For several years, activists and organizations across the country have called for more affordable access to menstrual products, from tax-free tampons and pads to free hygiene items in schools, shelters and prisons. The Period Collective and the Chicago Period Project are two local nonprofits that help supply the products for those who cannot afford them. More states, including Illinois, have repealed state sales tax on tampons, menstrual pads and similar products.
