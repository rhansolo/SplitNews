(CNN) Four years ago on June 12, 2016, one of the worst mass shootings in US history claimed 49 lives at a Florida gay bar. This morning, people across the state will observe a moment of silence to honor those who were lost.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a proclamation declaring June 12 "Pulse Remembrance Day," in memory of those killed during a mass shooting at Pulse nightclub , a popular LGBTQ+ venue in Orlando in 2016.

The proclamation orders all flags to be lowered to half-mast, and Floridians are asked to mark the date with a moment of silence at 9 a.m. DeSantis declared Pulse Remembrance Day in 2019, too, and former Gov. Rick Scott did the same in 2018

In the early hours of June 12, 2016, 49 people were shot and killed and 50 others were injured. The shooting occurred during the club's Latin Night, and many of those killed were Latino and LGBTQ+.

The gunman, Omar Mateen, died in a shootout with police the same day. Authorities said he had pledged allegiance to ISIS.
