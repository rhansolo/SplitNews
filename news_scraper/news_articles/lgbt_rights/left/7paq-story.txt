According to the largest-ever survey devoted to the lives of the transgender community in the U.S. released in 2015, 70% of respondents reported having to endure some form of mistreatment because of their gender orientation, such as being kicked out of the shelter, being verbally harassed, physically attacked or sexually assaulted. Many said they avoided staying in a shelter for fear of harassment.
