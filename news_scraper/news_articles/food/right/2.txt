People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) praised the new packaging for Barnum’s Animals crackers Monday after the manufacturer caved to pressure and removed animal cages from its boxes.

PETA claimed Barnum’s Animals crackers’ new design reflects that “people are embracing compassion for animals like never before,” the organization wrote on its website. PETA referred to the updated design as “animal liberation” since the creatures are now depicted in the wild.

The American manufacturer Nabisco revamped the design after 116 years. PETA reached out to the manufacturer in 2016 with a complaint, according to WGN9. (RELATED: Google Employees Protested PETA For Being Offensive To Humans Who Face Racism)

“For more than a century, Nabisco’s Barnum’s Animals crackers have been sold in boxes that depict lions, gorillas, elephants, and other animals caged in a circus boxcar. But following discussions with PETA, in which we suggested a new design, the brand has redesigned the packaging to show animals free in nature instead of held captive in cages for human entertainment,” PETA wrote.

PETA also celebrated the packaging change on Twitter.

“We’re sending a big thanks to Nabisco!” PETA tweeted.

We’re sending a big thanks to Nabisco! After working with PETA, Barnum’s Animals Crackers iconic package now shows animals free in nature instead of captive in boxcars. It perfectly reflects that society no longer tolerates using wild animals in circuses! https://t.co/TZfQDQaLeL pic.twitter.com/6sR3I58thS — PETA (@peta) August 21, 2018
