Conservative advocacy group One Million Moms has condemned Burger King for its use of “profanity” in a commercial from August.

The ad campaign, first aired in August, finds customers waiting in line for a fake "Impossible Restaurant," which ends up being a Burger King storefront for the company’s plant-based Impossible Whopper. At the 45 second mark, one customer, after sampling the burger, says: “Damn, that’s good.”

In a statement published Friday, One Million Moms decried the use of “the d-word” in the ad campaign, calling the campaign “offensive” and “controversial.”

“Burger King’s Impossible Whopper ad is irresponsible and tasteless,” the organization wrote in the statement. “It is extremely destructive and damaging to impressionable children viewing the commercial. We all know children repeat what they hear.”

A petition started by the group to protest Burger King until it removes the profanity from its advertising has just over 9,000 signatories. One Million Moms itself had about 100,000 likes on Facebook as of early Monday morning.

The group's callout comes a month after the same group successfully campaigned for the Hallmark Channel to pull an ad for a wedding-planning company that featured a same-sex couple kissing at the altar. The channel reversed course a day after pulling the spot, apologizing for "the hurt it has unintentionally caused."

One Million Moms’ parent company, the American Family Association, has been designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group.
