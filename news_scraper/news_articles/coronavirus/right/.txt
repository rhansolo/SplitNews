White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said there is not a "second wave" of coronavirus cases spreading across the country, despite the stock market taking a plunge Thursday.

During a Friday appearance on Fox’s “Fox and Friends,” Kudlow said there is not a “second spike” in positive virus cases.

He said he is "not the health expert,” but he spoke with leading coronavirus health experts who assured him that "there is no emergency, there is no second wave.”

“They are saying there is no second spike. Let me repeat that. There is no second spike,” he said of his Thursday discussions with health experts.

He said he doesn’t know how rumors about a second wave of the coronavirus got started on Wall Street.

“What you do have is certain spots are seeing a little bit of a jump up. Some small metropolitan areas are seeing it. The CDC and the health people are all over it. They’ve sent some task forces out to deal with it,” Kudlow said.

He added that an uptick in positive cases can be attributed partly to an increase in testing capacity.

“The rate of increase of new cases is between zero and 1%. It has really flattened out,” he said.

Several states, including Arizona, Florida and Texas, have recently reported large increases in positive COVID-19 cases.
