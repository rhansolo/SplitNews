Former Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt was sworn in as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Friday night, hours after the Senate confirmed his nomination.

Associate Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito Jr. administered the oath of office to Mr. Pruitt. Vice President Mike Pence, who has presided over the swearing in of Cabinet members, is attending an international security conference in Munich, Germany, where he is set to deliver a speech Saturday and meet with several U.S. allies.

The Senate confirmed Mr. Pruitt Friday by a vote of 52-46 after Democrats failed in an all-night effort to stall the floor vote.
