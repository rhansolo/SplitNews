House Democrats dealt a symbolic blow to Republicans’ tax code overhaul Thursday on the two-year anniversary of that law’s passage.

On a mostly party-line vote of 218-206, the House passed a bill that would make good on a top Democratic tax priority: lifting a $10,000 limit on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. It was amended to prevent households earning more than $100 million from claiming unlimited deductions, however, after a procedural motion offered by Republicans won enough bipartisan support.

The bill would generally give taxpayers a two-year reprieve on the deduction limit Republicans imposed as part of their 2017 tax code overhaul. Taxpayers would be able to write off the full cost of state and local taxes when they file 2020 and 2021 federal returns. The measure would also double the SALT deduction limit for married couples on 2019 returns.

Democrats would make up the $184.5 billion drain in federal revenues over the coming decade by increasing the top marginal tax rate for individuals from 37 percent to 39.6 percent — the same level that existed before the GOP tax overhaul. That rate would be permanent, while the SALT cap would return in 2022 under the bill.
