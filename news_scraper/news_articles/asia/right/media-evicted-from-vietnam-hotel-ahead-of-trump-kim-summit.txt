Members of the media were told to leave a hotel in Hanoi on Tuesday before the arrival of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The White House had set up a press filing center at the Melia hotel for the duration of President Trump’s summit with Kim, scheduled to take place Wednesday and Thursday.

The White House gave no explanation for the move, according to Bloomberg, but it turns out the North Korean leader had plans to stay at the hotel.

“You must go now! This way,” a Vietnamese security officer told journalists in the hotel lobby.

News organizations were relocated to another location a few blocks from the hotel.

NBC News described the move as “ highly unusual” because the White House had help set up the use of the space.

It was not immediately clear which government was behind the move — Vietnam, North Korea, or the U.S.

Trump and Kim are meeting for the second time in a less than a year to discuss the possible denuclearization of North Korea. Trump is set to arrive in Vietnam on Tuesday morning.
