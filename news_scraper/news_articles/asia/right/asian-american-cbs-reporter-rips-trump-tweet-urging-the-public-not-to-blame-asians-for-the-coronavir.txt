CBS News White House Correspondent Weijia Jiang took issue with President Trump when he called on the public to protect the Asian American community and not blame it for the coronavirus.

Suggesting that message was derogatory toward Asians, she tweeted, “Trump: Asian *Americans* need protection. Also Trump: ‘They’ are working with ‘us.’”

Her tweet came on the heels of a Trump tweet calling for the Asian American community to be protected.

“It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world,” Trump said Monday. “They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!”

Earlier this month, Jiang claimed that a Trump administration official used the term “Kung Flu” to describe the virus.

“This morning a White House official referred to #Coronavirus as the “Kung-Flu” to my face,” she tweeted on March 17. “Makes me wonder what they’re calling it behind my back.”

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway challenged Jiang to name the official who said it.

“I’d like to know who they are. But hold on, you can’t just say that and not name them,” Conway said as she gestured to Jiang. “Tell us who it was. Come up here and tell us who it was.”

“You can’t just make an accusation and not tell us who it is," Conway added. "Who is it?”
