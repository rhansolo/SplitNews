“Birthright citizenship,” the constitutional rule that a child born in and under the jurisdiction of the United States is a U.S. citizen, is in the news a lot these days. Several G.O.P. candidates, including Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum and Scott Walker, have joined Donald Trump in calling for an end to this rule — or at the very least questioning it — as part of their immigration platforms.

Should birthright citizenship be abolished and, if so, what impact would it have in the United States? What alternative citizenship model should the U.S. adopt instead?
