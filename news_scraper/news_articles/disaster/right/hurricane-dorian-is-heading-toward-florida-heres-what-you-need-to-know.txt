Hurricane Dorian is heading toward the east coast of Florida and growing stronger.

How bad is this hurricane?

Hurricane Dorian was recently upgraded from a Category 2 hurricane (winds between 96 and 110 mph) to a Category 4 (winds between 130 and 156 mph).

According to the National Hurricane Center, at this level of hurricane strength, "well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months."

Where is it now?

Dorian is currently over the Caribbean heading toward the east coast of Florida. It has already hit the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, but was much weaker at the time (it was a Category 1, with winds up to 95 mph) and caused only minor damage.

President Donald Trump has already declared a state of emergency and authorized FEMA to conduct disaster relief efforts in the affected areas.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) has also declared a state of emergency in 26 of Florida's 67 counties and is expected to make a final decision Friday on whether or not to order evacuations in some parts of the state.



According to the National Hurricane Center, Dorian is expected to begin making landfall "in parts of Florida as early as Sunday morning."
