President Trump presented an outdated forecast map for Hurricane Dorian on Wednesday that was altered to show Alabama could be hit by the storm.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president gave an update on Hurricane Dorian, which is now hugging the East Coast near Florida and Georgia.

Trump ushered acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan to bring out the map, which was from last week as Dorian appeared to not even have reached the Bahamas yet. The short-term forecast cone covers the Bahamas, and its extended reach, outlined in white, covers the Florida Peninsula.

But added to the National Hurricane Center graphic was a black semicircle next to the NHC forecast cone that reached over the Florida panhandle and a part of Alabama.

"You see it was going to hit not only Florida, but Georgia. It could have -- it was going toward the Gulf. That was what we -- what was originally projected. And it took a right turn and ultimately -- hopefully, we’re going to be lucky. It depends on what happens with South Carolina and North Carolina. But it’s heading up the coast, and Florida was grazed. Mostly wind. And we’re going to have a report on that," Trump said. He added later, "Everybody thought that this was about a 95% probability."

A reporter noted that it looked like the map was changed with a sharpie. Trump said, "I don't know. I don't know."

It is unclear who added the outlined area in black.

Falsifying a federal government forecast is illegal, according to the U.S. Code. "Whoever knowingly issues or publishes any counterfeit weather forecast or warning of weather conditions falsely representing such forecast or warning to have been issued or published by the Weather Bureau, United States Signal Service, or other branch of the Government service, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ninety days, or both," the text of 18 U.S. Code § 2074 states.

Some meteorologists were upset at the sight of doctored graphic, expressing their dismay on social media.

Insane people: Extrapolating the NHC 5-day cone of Hurricane #Dorian is most definitely an impeachable offense.

A spokesperson for the National Hurricane Center did not immediately return a request for comment.

Over the past few days, Trump has repeatedly said Alabama was in real danger from Dorian, even as forecasters discounted the possibility of the hurricane crossing the Florida Peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico and being in the vicinity of Alabama.

By Labor Day weekend, computer models generally agreed that Dorian, which had just become a "major" Category 5 hurricane with 180 miles per hour sustained maximum winds, would pass over the northern Bahamas and then turn north off the East Coast.

Yet, Trump repeatedly mentioned Alabama as possibly getting hit "harder than anticipated" on Sunday. This came after White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters on Saturday that someone from the Federal Emergency Management Agency was traveling with the president as he was playing golf and “he’s being briefed every hour.”

"In addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!" Trump tweeted late Sunday morning.

About 20 minutes later, the National Weather Service station in Birmingham tweeted that Alabama would not see "any impacts" from Dorian because it was projected to remain too far east.

Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx — NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019

In a second tweet, the NWS Birmingham account explained that any showers in the area would have no association with Dorian.

The scattered showers and storms we are expecting across Central AL today are not associated with Dorian. — NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019

But Trump again mentioned Alabama during a hurricane briefing by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as he was advising American citizens in Dorian's path to heed the warnings and evacuation orders from local authorities.

"It may get a little piece of a great place — it's called Alabama, and Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds," Trump said on Sunday. "This just came up, unfortunately. It's the size of the storm that we're talking about. So for Alabama, please be careful also."

The Washington Examiner emailed the National Weather Service to ask if the Birmingham station's tweet was sent in response to Trump or because of calls coming into the station from people concerned the hurricane would be turning towards Alabama.

NWS spokeswoman Susan Buchanan wrote back saying the latter was true. "The National Weather Service forecast office in Birmingham responded to inquiries to assure the public that Alabama was not in the projected path," she said.

On Labor Day, Trump lashed out at the media for reporting his warning about Alabama, singling out ABC News' Jonathan Karl.

"Such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter @jonkarl of @ABCWorldNews. I suggested yesterday at FEMA that, along with Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, even Alabama could possibly come into play, which WAS true. They made a big deal about this ... when in fact, under certain original scenarios, it was in fact correct that Alabama could have received some 'hurt,'” Trump said in a pair of tweets Monday. "Always good to be prepared! But the Fake News is only interested in demeaning and belittling. Didn’t play my whole sentence or statement. Bad people!"

Dorian slammed the Bahamas over Labor Day weekend, killing at least five people, before taking aim at the coasts of Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.
