"I've done enough"

It’s been more than three weeks since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, leaving millions of American citizen still fighting to simply survive. Food remains scarce.

Why is that? Because according to a source that Trump cites, a “financial crisis looms largely of their [Puerto Rico’s] own making.” And by the way, that source is the author of two books. One a smear against Barack Obama and the other about “fake news” controlling what you think. Seems reliable.

But fear not, fellow citizens of Puerto Rico … Trump did throw some paper towels into a crowd recently, so you’ll be fine.
