During a briefing at the White House Tuesday afternoon, Press Secretary Kayleigh McEneny corrected Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren after she presented false Wuhan coronavirus data at a Senate hearing earlier in the day.

"I talk to Dr. Birx regularly. In fact, I talked to her just before I came out here because I had some questions about some funny numbers I heard from Elizabeth Warren and she helped me to correct those numbers which I'd like to correct here because I think it's unfair to the American people to give inflated case numbers and mortality numbers because it leads to those same Americans making a decision to not get a mammogram, to not have the cancer screenings they need so I'd like to reveal some information Dr. Birx just shared with me," McEnany said.

"Elizabeth Warren erroneously said there were 25,000 new cases today, in fact there were less than 20,000. Senator Warren said there were 2000 deaths, in fact there have been less than a 1000. I spoke to Dr. Birx about that so I would encourage our Democrat colleagues and all Americans to make sure we're putting out good information because it does have consequences," she continued.

Meanwhile, the White House continues to help states access testing supplies in order to get through the three-phase reopening guidelines issued by the Wuhan coronavirus task force last month.
