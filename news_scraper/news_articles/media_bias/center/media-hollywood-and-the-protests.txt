From the Left

The left generally supports the editor’s firing and canceling ‘Cops’ but is divided about Gone With the Wind.

“[Cotton was] calling for what would almost certainly amount to massive violence against his fellow citizens: an ‘overwhelming show of force to disperse, detain and ultimately deter lawbreakers’… on Twitter [he] called for ‘no quarter for insurrectionists, anarchists, rioters, and looters.’ As David French, a conservative writer who is, like Cotton, a veteran of the war in Iraq, pointed out, ‘no quarter’ orders — which mean showing the enemy no mercy, even if they try to surrender — are a war crime… The value of airing Cotton’s argument has to be weighed against the message The Times sends, in this incendiary moment, by including it within the bounds of legitimate debate.”

“Cotton’s op-ed doesn’t meet the Times’s standards, not only because it contains inaccuracies but because it reflects a worldview incompatible with the baseline small-l liberal values that make the Times’s work, and journalism generally, possible…



“Modern journalism was meant to play a political role, to expose the truth and hold politicians accountable to the small-l liberal values that make liberal democracy possible. It cannot remain neutral when those values are under threat… [The media] must sound the alarm, if only to defend the conditions that make it possible. The journalists injured and arrested so far would not be the last in Tom Cotton’s America.”

Critics, however, argue that “The most concerning thing about the Cotton episode is the logic that was given to pull the column in the first place: ‘Running this puts Black people, including Black @nytimes staff, in danger,’ a phrase repeated thousands of times on social media. The line of reasoning here is perfectly coherent. We can easily imagine a world where Cotton’s op-ed persuades Trump to deploy troops, who then kill protesters and reporters, many of them black. But we could envision a similar sequence resulting from any number of op-eds…



“Suppose the Times had given an op-ed to an advocate of repealing Obamacare at the crucial moment, persuading John McCain to supply the deciding vote to eliminate it. Millions of people would have lost insurance, and as a direct result, tens of thousands of them would have died… Politics is a matter of life and death. If you start with the premise that one side has a monopoly on truth, you inevitably land on the conclusion that questioning its ideas is dangerous.”

Regarding TV shows, “From ‘Dragnet’ to ‘NYPD Blue’ to ‘FBI,’ the cop show is a prolific American institution that is immensely influential. In the 2019-2020 TV season, three of the top five dramas were cop shows…



“When we talk about representation in movies and television, we often point at the voices and faces that are missing. But we also need to look at the voices and faces that are overrepresented. Too often police are beacons of morality who never do wrong. Too often criminals are people of color, particularly black men. Too often victims are forgettable and laws optional when you carry a badge and a gun… we shouldn’t act as if they’re harmless entertainment, or ‘just TV.’ If TV didn’t have the power to influence and change the minds of viewers, there would be no point in selling commercials that fund your favorite shows.”

Regarding HBO’s decision, some say that “Even the most well-intentioned films can fall short in how they represent marginalized communities. ‘Gone With the Wind,’ however, is its own unique problem. It doesn’t just ‘fall short’ with regard to representation. It is a film that glorifies the antebellum south. It is a film that, when it is not ignoring the horrors of slavery, pauses only to perpetuate some of the most painful stereotypes of people of color… At a moment when we are all considering what more we can do to fight bigotry and intolerance, I would ask that all content providers look at their libraries and make a good-faith effort to separate programming that might be lacking in its representation from that which is blatant in its demonization.”
