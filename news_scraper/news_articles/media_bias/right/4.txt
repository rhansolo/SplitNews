Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says any move by Google to cut off ad revenue to The Federalist and Zero Hedge websites is “Orwellian.”

Cruz made his comments on Thursday’s “Fox & Friends.”

NBC News reported that Google has banned Zero Hedge, a libertarian website, over policy violations found in the comments section of stories about Black Lives Matter protests. The news network also said Google had issued a warning to The Federalist over comments on articles related to recent protests.

A Google spokesperson had first said it had demonetized both websites, according to NBC News.

But Google insisted that The Federalist was "never demonetized" and that it was the site's comments section that was in question, not any articles published by the site. Zero Hedge had already been demonetized.

Cruz said he sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai pointing out that the standard the company is claiming to apply doesn’t “apply fairly and across-the-board."

"I listed about a dozen left-wing websites all of which have comment sections and none of which apparently are being policed or having that standard applied," he said.
