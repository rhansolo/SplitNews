President Donald Trump coined a new term is his fight for the soul of America. It is "COVID Shame," and he is using it to call out Democrats and liberal media for hypocrisy.

They are fine with "rioters & looters" gathering to destroy American cities, but they are trying to "COVID Shame" Trump supporters from gathering in an election year, he said.

Trump tweeted Monday:

"The Far Left Fake News Media, which had no Covid problem with the Rioters & Looters destroying Democrat run cities, is trying to Covid Shame us on our big Rallies. Won't work!"

A California Republican candidate who lost in a battle against Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., Omar Navarro replied via tweet:

"They don't want us spreading the MAGA Virus."

Trump says almost 1 million of his supporters have applied to attend his Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally. The rally was planned for Juneteenth – Friday, June 19 – but Democrats and activists did not want the U.S. president to celebrate Freedom Day in Tulsa, which was the location of a race massacre 99 years ago.

Juneteenth is the annual celebration of the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation that freed slaves once and for all after the Civil War in 1865.
