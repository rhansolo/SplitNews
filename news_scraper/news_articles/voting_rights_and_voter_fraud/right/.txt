Twitter relied on the Democrat Media Complex's so-called "fact-checkers" to say that election fraud isn't a concern with absentee voting, also referred to as mail-in voting. What's ironic is the added the fact check on the very same day the Department of Justice pressed charges against a mail carrier for none other than attempted voter fraud.

Pendleton County West Virginia mail carrier Thomas Cooper is accused of altering the mail-in absentee request forms for eight voters. According to the DOJ, the voters' party preference was altered. Five ballots had been altered from "Democrat" to "Republican." The other three request forms were altered but the party preference was left untouched.

When the clerk discovered the alterations, a report was filed with the West Virginia Secretary of State’s office. An investigation into tampered request forms from the towns of Onego, Riverton, and Franklin, West Virginia – the very area Cooper serviced – was launched.

An affidavit stated that the 47-year-old admitted to changing the request forms, something he considered to be a "joke."

Multiple government agencies were involved in the investigation, including the West Virginia Election Fraud Task Force, led by Assistant United States Attorneys from both the Northern and Southern Districts of West Virginia, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and investigators from the West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office.

The state is allowing voters to participate in the June 9th primary election via mail because of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. In order to obtain a ballot, voters must submit an absentee ballot application to their county clerk. Each county clerk was also scheduled to mail "COVID-19 mail cards" to eligible voters.
