Resurfaced racial and homophobic jokes were enough for the PC police to take down the newest comedian added to the Saturday Night Live cast, it was announced Monday.

"After talking with Shane Gillis, we have decided that he will not be joining SNL," the statement read.

Gillis only lasted a few days before online outrage erupted over racist and homophobic comments he made while a guest on a podcast.

"We want SNL to have a variety of voices and points of view within the show, and we hired Shane on the strength of his talent as comedian and his impressive audition for SNL," the statement continued. "We were not aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days. The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard."



Gillis posted a statement via his Twitter account after the announcement.

"It feels ridiculous for comedians to be making serious public statements but here we are," he said.

"I'm a comedian who was funny enough to get SNL. That can't be taken away. Of course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand it would be too much of a distraction. I respect the decision they made. I'm honestly grateful for the opportunity," Gillis added.

"I was always a mad tv guy anyway," he joked.

Gillis tried to explain his comments on Thursday in a statement on Twitter.

'I'm a comedian who pushes boundaries. I sometimes miss. If you go through my 10 years of comedy, most of it bad, you're going to find a lot of bad misses," he wrote.

"I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said. My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks," he concluded.
