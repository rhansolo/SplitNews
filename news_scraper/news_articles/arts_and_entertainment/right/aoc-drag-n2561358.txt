Conservatives blasted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for appearing on the next season of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” as a guest judge, where she's seen “pledging allegiance to the drag” in a trailer for the VH1 show.

"RuPaul's Drag Race and Untucked return with more sickening styles, fierce challenges and backstage drama," VH1 states. "Michelle Visage, Carson Kressley, Ross Mathews and celeb guest judges join RuPaul as she sets out to crown America's Next Drag Superstar in this Emmy Award-winning show."

In promoting Season 12, which premiers February 28 at 8/7 central, VH1 says, “Get ready for fierce looks, killer comedy, herstoric competition and plenty of shade…”

Time well spent in Congress. https://t.co/t0sxagViGT — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) February 13, 2020

Guys I'm starting to think she doesn't want to actually legislate and is only using a congressional seat to boost a celebrity profile. Will investigate further and report back. — Stephen Miller (@redsteeze) February 13, 2020

AOC is proud to “pledge allegiance to the Drag”



I wonder why she never claims to be proud to “pledge allegiance to the Flag”

Ocasio-Cortez said it was "100% a peak experience" and hit back at critics, telling them "they can go back to Party City," which is a reference from an earlier season of the show when a contestant insulted a competitor for having cheap clothing.

The New York Democrat isn't the first lawmaker to appear on the show. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was a guest judge in 2018.
