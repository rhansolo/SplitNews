A pair of comedians swapped out the jackets on copies of Donald Trump, Jr.'s new book with ones that read, "Daddy, Please Love Me: How Everything I Do Is Try To Earn My Father's Love."

Trump Jr., 41, published a new book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us, on Tuesday. After the book’s release, comedians Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler replaced a number of book jackets at a New York Barnes and Noble and posted pictures of the prank on Twitter.

"We changed the cover of @DonaldJTrumpJr's book to make it a little more honest and put them up in @BNBuzz. You're welcome, Junior! #DonnyLovesDaddy," the pair, known as The Good Liars, posted on their account with an image of the fake covers.

Trump appeared on a number of network shows earlier this week while promoting his book. His appearance on ABC's The View generated significant coverage after he clashed with the majority liberal hosts over his father’s presidency and other aspects about his family.

While defending his father, Trump also took the opportunity to criticize the network for its treatment of a network whistleblower that leaked a clip of ABC host Amy Robach saying that the network spiked a story of hers on the late alleged pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

"Let's not kid ourselves," Trump said in his Tuesday appearance. "ABC right now is chasing down a whistleblower about all of the Epstein stuff because those stories were killed. So, if we're going to have the conversation about the outrage of whistleblowers, you worked with CBS to out the whistleblower."
