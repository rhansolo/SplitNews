Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Hollywood’s usually bustling studios are empty. And many productions — including Netflix’s popular show “Stranger Things” — have been put on pause indefinitely.

Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told CNN Business that all Netflix productions around the world have been shut down. He called the COVID-19 outbreak a “massive disruption” to all streaming companies.

But Sarandos said Netflix subscribers can still expect new content to appear on the platform for at least the next few months. But the streaming site may run out of original content to post toward the end of the year if production can’t resume.

In-person production has shut down, but Decider reports that many Netflix original series — such as the cast of “Big Mouth” — have been using technology to help with the creative processes and even host virtual table reads.

Sarandos also said Netflix will be paying all crews their full salaries for two weeks following the production shutdown. The Hollywood Reporter reports that as of Friday, Netflix has set up a $100 million relief fund for production crews and professionals without jobs.
