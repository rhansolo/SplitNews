This notion that they were pulling my strings is one created by right-wing media outlets. It’s just a way of putting a pin in something that scares them. I don’t know why the idea of making sure every American is taken care of should scare a politician. It certainly doesn’t scare the average guy who’s got a job that he doesn’t like and is afraid to quit it because he’s got a pre-existing condition and he may well not get another good job with insurance.

Do you think some of your detractors are trying to influence what you can or can’t talk about on your show?

I think some of them are. I think some of them are just trying to get Fox News to hire them as on-air commentators. It’s sad. You see people try to engage me in battle that are just trying to give their careers a boost. I won’t be a part of that. With the rare exception.

Like your back-and-forth on Twitter with Donald Trump Jr.?

I think he’s just trying to position himself as someone of importance, and he seems to be looking for high-profile media figures to fight with. If you go through his Twitter feed, it’s one desperate cry for attention after another. For whatever reason, I decided to give some to him.

Has there ever been a moment over these recent months, as you’ve waded further into these politicized debates, where ABC stepped in and said, “You can’t do that”?

No, never. They had more concerns about my beard.

Some people have looked back to the comedy you were doing on “The Man Show,” which was often crude and chauvinistic, and said, who is he to get up on his high horse? Does that past work invalidate what you’re saying now?
