White House spokesman Raj Shah on Monday panned Hillary Clinton’s cameo appearance during Sunday night’s Grammy awards, telling Fox News that award show criticism directed at President Donald Trump ought to be dismissed as the complaints of out-of-touch liberals.

“When I see Hillary Clinton and other liberal politicians join forces with celebrities or try to show America how in touch they are, I don't take it all that seriously,” Shah, a deputy White House press secretary, told “Fox & Friends.” “You know, the left and the elite centers of America are frankly out of touch with what's going on in this country and all the great work that this president is doing. And I wouldn't take a whole lot of what you see on a Sunday night Grammy appearance by celebrities attacking president all that seriously.”

Corden’s “Fire and Fury” bit, which also included other celebrities reading from the book, prompted online criticism from Donald Trump Jr., who wrote that “getting to read a #fakenews book excerpt at the Grammys seems like a great consolation prize for losing the presidency,” and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who wrote that she has “always loved the Grammys but to have artists read the Fire and Fury book killed it. Don’t ruin great music with trash.”

The president was a target for much of the Grammy award proceedings, with performances and acceptance speeches littered with attacks against the president’s policies and rhetoric. Monday morning, Shah linked the criticism directed at the president to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s criticism of the package of tax cuts and reforms that Trump signed last year.

“You know, I don't know if he watched it,” Shah said when asked if the president had watched the award show. “But I wouldn't take the words of these celebrities or these liberal politicians all that seriously.”
