(CNN) President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday night about a matter that had been percolating in pro-Trump media circles all day: the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. editing him out of "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York."

Trump made a cameo appearance -- about seven seconds long -- in the beloved 1992 Christmas comedy. But his supporters noticed that the cameo did not appear in the version that aired on the CBC this December.

A Thursday panel on Fox News' morning show "Fox & Friends" decried Trump's exclusion , calling it an example of "censorship" and anti-Trump "derangement." Donald Trump Jr. later tweeted an article that called the omission "pathetic" and made an Instagram post calling it "bias." And then the President weighed in himself, tweeting another article on the controversy and making reference to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: "I guess Justin T doesn't much like my making him pay up on NATO or Trade!"

Trump then tweeted an article about the "Fox & Friends" criticism of the CBC. He added a joke: "The movie will never be the same! (just kidding)."

It's very possible the President was also joking with his suggestion that Trudeau had a hand in deleting him from a children's film. But since others are taking this matter quite seriously, we're going to set the record straight.
