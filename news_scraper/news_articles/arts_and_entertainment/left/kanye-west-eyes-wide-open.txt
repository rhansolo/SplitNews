My eyes are now wide open and now realize I’ve been used to spread messages I don’t believe in. I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative !!!

Kanye West has apparently had enough with politics, explaining in a series of tweets on Tuesday that his eyes "are now wide open."

I introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn’t want their name on it so she used mine. I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it.

More specifically, West shut down recent accusations that he designed the shirts for Candace Owens' Blexit campaign, which seeks to convince black voters to exit the Democratic Party.

Over the weekend, she was quoted by Page 6 as gushing about West's involvement.

“Blexit is a renaissance and I am blessed to say that this logo, these colors, were created by my dear friend and fellow superhero Kanye West,” she reportedly said.

But on Monday, Owens released a statement supporting West's claim, saying, "BLEXIT is a project that is mine entirely."

And then on Wednesday, she posted a blog calling "rumors" of her past statements "a lie that seems to have made its way around the world."

“Kanye was completely right to feel used in that regard and as I have done personally, I would like to publicly apologize to him for any undue stress or pain the effort to correct that rumor has caused him, his business relationships, or his family,” she wrote. “He simply never designed them.”

West has been a lightning rod for controversy, but that bled into politics with his embrace of Donald Trump and the "Make America Great Again" campaign. Two years after meeting with Trump when he was president-elect, West went to the Oval Office to meet again the now-president. But what started as a sit-down to discuss prison reform, manufacturing, and gang violence devolved into the two men showering each other with compliments. West even referred to the MAGA hat Trump gave him as "a Superman cape."
