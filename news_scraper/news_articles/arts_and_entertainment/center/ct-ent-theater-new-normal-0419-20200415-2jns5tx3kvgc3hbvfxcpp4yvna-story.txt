In the non-profit arts sector, where humanistic compassion, progressive values and hopes for longterm government rescue are yet more ingrained into the ecosystem, opening too soon is also politically and morally fraught. Nobody wants to be accused of putting performers or audiences at risk. On the other hand, laying off staff in the absence of revenue is also unpopular; art institutions are between the proverbial rock and a hard place. Government support is hoped for, and there have been admirable local efforts trickling in, but federal help has been slow in coming. It is also worth noting that the corporate parent of the small steakhouse chain Ruth’s Chris has already received $20 million in potentially forgivable loans: that’s more than 25 percent of the $75 million earmarked for the entire arts sector, although some organizations may also be eligible for other federal programs.
