Washington (CNN) Progress in talks to reopen the government remains at a standstill after Saturday's meeting with Trump administration officials and congressional staff, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Saturday.

Mulvaney told CNN's Jake Tapper that they "did not make much progress" at the meeting, adding that he thought Democrats were "actually, in my mind, there to stall."

"We didn't make much progress at the meeting, which was surprising to me," Mulvaney said. "I thought we had come in to talk about terms that we could agree on, places where we all agreed we should be spending more time, more attention, things we could do to improve our border security. And yet the opening line from one of the lead Democrat negotiators was that they were not there to talk about any agreement."

President Donald Trump also said in a tweet Saturday afternoon that the meeting didn't make "much headway."

"V.P. Mike Pence and team just left the White House," Trump wrote . "Briefed me on their meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives. Not much headway made today. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!"
