The second of four Minneapolis police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd has reportedly been released from jail after posting bail.

J. Alexander Kueng, 26, was freed from the Hennepin County Jail shortly before 7:30 p.m. Friday after meeting his bail set at $750,000, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

Keung is among three now-fired officers charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter for their roles in helping pin Floyd down before he died on Memorial Day.

His release follows that of fired rookie cop Thomas Lane, 37, who managed to post his $750,000 bail through a crowdfunding effort.

Lane was working his fourth shift when he held Floydâ€™s legs while supervisor Derek Chauvin kept a knee on his neck for almost nine minutes.

Keung was also fresh to the force and on his third shift when he helped restrain Floyd during his fatal arrest.

The third officer, Tou Thao, is still being held in jail on $750,000 bail.

Chauvin is also still jailed, facing second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter with his bail set at $1.25 million.

If convicted as charged, all four defendants face up to 40 years in prison.
