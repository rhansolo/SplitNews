On World Press Freedom Day, President Trump said the press won’t truly be free until it covers him correctly.

“Unfortunately some of the press doesn’t cover me accurately,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “In fact, they go out of their way to cover me inaccurately, so I don’t think that’s a free press. I think that’s a dishonest press.”

The president said The New York Times, a frequent target of his complaints about “fake news,” finally pleased him Friday with a front-page story about the Obama administration’s spying on his campaign in 2016.

“For the first time … they were talking about spying on my campaign,” Mr. Trump said. “That’s a big difference between the way they’ve been covering. But that’s a big story, that’s absolutely bigger than Watergate as far as I’m concerned.”

But he said such stories that make him happy are rare.

“I think I have a very good relationship with some of the press,” the president said. “I get treated fairly by some press, but I get treated very unfairly by other press. And frankly I think that’s very dishonest and I don’t consider that [free press] when you have stories that are purposely written badly. That’s not free press, that’s the opposite of free press.”
