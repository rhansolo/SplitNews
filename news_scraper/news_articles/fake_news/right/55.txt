President Trump on Saturday blasted what he called the “phony” BuzzFeed story and the mainstream media’s coverage of it.

“It hurts me to say it but mainstream media has truly lost its credibility,” said the president. “This is a very bad thing for our country.”

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office rebuked the BuzzFeed report Friday that it had evidence Mr. Trump directed his former personal attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress, a serious crime and potentially impeachable offense.

The pushback from Mr. Mueller’s Russia probe came after breathless coverage of the BuzzFeed story by major newspapers and TV news.

“It was a disgrace to our country. It was a disgrace to journalism,” said Mr. Trump. “I think the coverage in the mainstream media was disgraceful.”

Mr. Trump made the remarks to reporters as he left the White House for Dover Air Force Base for the return of four Americans killed in Syria.
