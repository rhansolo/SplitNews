Social media networks are scrambling to get rid of a viral conspiracy video spreading false claims about the coronavirus, according to a report.

The roughly 26-minute “Plandemic Movie” has been viewed and shared widely on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Vimeo, and clips of it also circulated on Twitter this week, CNBC reported.

The clip, apparently an excerpt of a larger documentary to be released this summer, makes a number of bogus, unproven or misleading claims, like that the coronavirus pandemic was created to make profits off vaccines.

And in defiance of the advice of medical experts, it suggests that masks can make people sicker and that sheltering in place harms the immune system.

One video, shared on Facebook by someone claiming to be one of the filmmakers, had been viewed more than 1.7 million times and shared more than 140,000 times as of Thursday.

Facebook told CNBC that the video violated its policy and would be removed.

“Suggesting that wearing a mask can make you sick could lead to imminent harm, so we’re removing the video,” a Facebook spokeswoman said.

One clip circulating on YouTube videos received more than 1 million views before it was removed, according to the MIT Technology Review.

The company said the video, one of three on the site, was scrapped for making claims about a cure for the virus not backed by health organizations.

The other two were borderline, meaning that YouTube decided they didn’t violate rules, but that they would no longer be recommended or show up prominently in search results, the MIT Technology Review said.

Vimeo also said the video was removed for violating standards regarding “content that spreads harmful and misleading health information.”

Meanwhile, Twitter said it had banned the hashtags #PlagueofCorruption and #PlandemicMovie from trends and searches.
