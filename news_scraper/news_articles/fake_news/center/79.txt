Giving facts a fighting chance

As part of a comprehensive effort to combat misinformation about COVID-19 and the strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes it, NLP created this resource page to provide accurate information about the pandemic.

It includes free resources for educators, students and the general public, along with links to authoritative sources of health information. Youâ€™ll also find tips, tools and quizzes to build news literacy skills that will last long after this public health crisis abates.

We are refreshing the content of this page periodically. Follow us on social media for timely updates.
