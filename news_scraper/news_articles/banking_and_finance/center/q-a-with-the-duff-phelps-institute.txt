We were excited to sit down with two fellows from The Duff & Phelps Institute to discuss their past experience in the public sector.



Duff & Phelps is a well-known global advisory firm; The Duff & Phelps Institute was launched in 2019. In their words:



Duff & Phelps was founded to be the gold standard in giving financial and business advice. Today, we’re a $4.2 billion company that employs approximately four thousand people around the world. On our journey we’ve heard a lot about the challenges our clients have had. We launched the Institute to reflect these challenges to the wider world and show people how we’ve been solving them. For example, there have been some real misses on IPOs and valuations recently; we can provide a unique perspective on those issues. The aim is to raise the level of public discourse to reflect what we hear from our clients.
