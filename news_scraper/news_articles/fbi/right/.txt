President Trump slammed his current FBI Director Christopher Wray for his response to the newly released report from the Department of Justice inspector general.

"I don’t know what report current Director of the FBI Christopher Wray was reading, but it sure wasn’t the one given to me," Trump said Tuesday on Twitter. "With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI, which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men & women working there!"

Wray emphasized that the inspector general did not find political bias by the FBI in its decision to investigate the Trump campaign. "The inspector general did not find political bias or improper motivations impacting the opening of the investigation or the decision to use certain investigative tools during the investigations," Wray said. He did admit there were ways the FBI "fell short of the standard of conduct and performance that we, and that I as director, expect from our employees."
