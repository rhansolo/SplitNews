Carter Page, the former Trump campaign aide who was surveilled by the FBI, slapped the Democratic National Committee with a lawsuit, and said that he was just beginning.

Page filed the lawsuit on Thursday at the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Illinois' Eastern Division.

Surveillance of Page under a FISA warrant has been at the center of the accusations by President Donald Trump and his allies that former officials of the Obama administration abused the power of the government out of political motivations.

Defenders of the surveillance say that the warrants were obtained legally, even if they did not result in evidence of wrongdoing.

Page's attorney John Pierce said in a statement that the lawsuit would help prevent any future FISA abuses.

"This is a first step to ensure that the full extent of the FISA abuse that has occurred during the last few years is exposed and remedied," Pierce said. "Defendants and those they worked with inside the federal government did not and will not succeed in making America a surveillance state."

He implied that there would be more lawsuits following that against the DNC.

"This is only the first salvo. We will follow the evidence wherever it leads, no matter how high," he added.

The lawsuit seeks "compensatory, special and punitive damages in appropriate amounts to be established at trial," without establishing a financial amount they are seeking.

"The rule of law will prevail," Pierce concluded.
