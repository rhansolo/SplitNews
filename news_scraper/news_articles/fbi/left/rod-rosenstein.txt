Mr. Graham and Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, plan to ask their panels on Thursday to empower them to issue subpoenas related to the Russia investigation. Those would seek reams of records and testimony from dozens of current and former law enforcement and national security officials, including prominent members of the Obama administration.

The session was the first major investigative hearing the Senate has had in months, scheduled despite the economic and health crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic and amid days of national unrest over police brutality. Democrats insisted repeatedly on Wednesday that those were far more obvious and urgent topics for the Senate’s consideration than an investigation that has already been widely scrutinized.

“I just do not understand why we as a committee are focusing on things that further deepen the discords of partisan posturing in America,” said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey and one of only three black senators. “I might be missing something, but to me we are in a pandemic like we have not seen since 1918, an economic crisis like we have not seen since the Depression and uprisings across America like we have not seen since 1968.”

Mr. Rosenstein was sworn in to the No. 2 post at the Justice Department just weeks before the president fired James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director, and within days Mr. Trump publicly and privately linked the dismissal to the Russia investigation. Mr. Rosenstein then called Mr. Mueller, a former F.B.I. director and prosecutor, out of retirement to lead the inquiry.

Mr. Mueller’s investigators found that while the Russian government covertly intervened in the 2016 election with a goal of helping Mr. Trump defeat Hillary Clinton, and while the Trump campaign welcomed that assistance and had many links to Russian figures, the evidence was insufficient to prove any criminal conspiracy.
