On Monday, senators will hear four hours of closing arguments, the time equally divided between the House impeachment manager and the president’s lawyers.

While Alexander said the action didn't warrant impeachment, he and other senators have criticized Trump's actions.

The House managers will argue, however, if senators agree that Trump tried to use his authority to get a foreign country to influence the upcoming election, it is their constitutional duty to remove him from office for abuse of power.

They will also hammer the point that removing Trump from office and the ballot only nine months before the general election would be a subversion of democracy.

The Senate on Monday afternoon will adjourn as an impeachment court once the closing arguments are finished and reconvene as a legislative body so that senators will have a chance to debate the articles of impeachment.

Under the Senate’s impeachment rules, senators are not allowed to deliver remarks or engage in colloquies. Under regular legislative procedures, they will be able to do so.

The Senate is scheduled to debate the impeachment articles in legislative session on Monday afternoon, Tuesday and Wednesday.

At 4 p.m. Wednesday, the Senate will reconvene as a court to vote on the articles of impeachment, with each senator expected to rise at his or her desk to announce whether or not Trump should be removed from office.

Following the vote, the trial will immediately conclude Wednesday afternoon.
