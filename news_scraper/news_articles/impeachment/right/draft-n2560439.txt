Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren submitted a nasty question for Chief Justice John Roberts to read on Thursday night. The question concerned the Chief Justice himself, and the look he gave Elizabeth Warren after reading it was priceless.

"Mr. Chief Justice," Warren dramatically announced. "I send a question to the desk."

Roberts then read the senator's question aloud.

"Does the fact that the Chief Justice is presiding over an impeachment trial in which GOP Senators have thus far refused to allow witnesses or evidence contribute to the loss of legitimacy of the Chief Justice, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution?"

When Roberts finished reading the question, the look he shot Elizabeth Warren said it all.

Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff then tried to do damage control, saying the lack of new witnesses doesn't reflect adversely on the Chief Justice at all but rather on the Senate, should they fail to do everything the Democrats are demanding.

WOW. Chief Justice John Roberts just had to read aloud Sen. Elizabeth Warren's question...about whether he loses credibility for presiding over a trial without witnesses or evidence. https://t.co/vG08pjmhZH pic.twitter.com/G79ZdRljZj — Heather Monahan (@HeatherMonahan_) January 30, 2020

Warren sure knows how to win them over. And she thinks she can bring this country together as president.
