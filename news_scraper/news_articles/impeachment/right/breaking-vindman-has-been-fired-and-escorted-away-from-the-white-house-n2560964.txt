Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman has been fired from the National Security Council and escorted out of the White House.

“Today, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was escorted out of the White House where he has dutifully served his country and his President. He does so having spoken publicly once, and only pursuant to a subpoena from the United States Congress," Vindman's attorney released in a statement.

Vindman's ousting comes as part of a restructuring of the NSC, which has been in the works for months.

Last year Vindman testified on behalf of Democrats during the impeachment inquiry in the House. He complained that President Trump did not use his prepared talking points for his now famous July 25th phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Further, under questioning from Republican Congressman Devin Nunes, Vindman appeared to admit he leaked information and violated the chain of command. He refused to answer questions about contact with the intelligence community and the whistleblower who prompted an impeachment inquiry against President Trump.

Rumbling of Vindman's firing started Thursday night and into Friday morning when President Trump retweeted the following:

I’d fire him. I listened to his testimony in the SCIF. He’s a leaker, not a whistleblower. Vindman was upset that @realDonaldTrump didn’t follow the script Vindman prepared for the phone call. Current Commander in Chief doesn’t take orders from a Lt. Col.!https://t.co/a9KYrfiVFN — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) February 7, 2020
