Former White House communications director Hope Hicks is set to return to the White House in a different role.

Hicks will join President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s team, according to a report Thursday from The New York Times. The report stated that Hicks will be a “counselor to the president,” but that she will not be in the communications office. (RELATED: Here Are The Best Moments From LSU’s White House Celebration)

Before her brief stint as communications director, Hicks served as the first ever White House Director of Strategic Communications, where she served for the first eight months of the administration, before being replaced by Mercedes Schlapp.

“Hope is not only someone with a deep understanding of President Trump, she is immensely loyal to him and his agenda,” Andy Surabian, GOP strategist and former Trump White House official told the Daily Caller. “Above all else, she is an extremely talented operative who I’m sure will serve the president and the American people well in her new role. The White House is lucky to get her back.”

The 31-year-old former model is a long-time Trump confidante, and was dragged before Congress last year to testify about the Mueller report. House Democrats were frustrated by Hicks and a White House lawyer’s refusal to answer questions, and called into question her credibility after she admitted to making up “white lies” for the president.
