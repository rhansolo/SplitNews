A Houston-area police officer fatally shot a woman who he said grabbed his Taser and used it against him, according to The Associated Press.

Baytown Police Lt. Steve Dorris said the officer, an 11-year veteran of the department, encountered the 45-year-old woman on Monday and attempted to arrest her on outstanding warrants while patrolling an apartment complex.

Dorris said the officer opened fire after the woman grabbed his Taser and used it on him, according to the AP.

A video recording of the incident shows the woman saying “You’re actually harassing me” and “I’m actually walking to my house,” and while on the ground she appears to reach toward the officer and say “I’m pregnant.” The officer later fired five shots.

Police said they could not determine whether the woman, whose name was not released, was pregnant and that an autopsy would be performed. The officer suffered no serious injuries, according to the AP.

“It’s a tragic event for everybody involved,” Dorris said. “Of course, our hearts go out to the family of the deceased as well as our officer.”

Dorris also said police are seeking the person who filmed the encounter as a witness to the shooting.

The incident happened the same day a former Michigan state trooper was sentenced to up to 15 years for using a Taser on a teen riding an all-terrain vehicle who was killed when he slammed into a parked truck.
