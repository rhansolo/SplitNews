Late last week, President Trump announced that he had called off a planned secret meeting between him and Taliban leaders at Camp David that had been set for this Sunday.

The scheduled meeting had been part of a year-long negotiations effort between the U.S. and Taliban in an attempt to begin the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

Trump blamed the fall-out on a recent Taliban car bomb attack in Kabul, tweeting: “If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don’t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway.”
