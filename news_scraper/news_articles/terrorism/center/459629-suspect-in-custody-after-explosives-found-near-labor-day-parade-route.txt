Dan Bryan, a spokesman for the governor, told the outlet that both the governor and his wife were set to participate in the parade.

A senior law enforcement official with the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness told NJ.com that the devices were discovered during a separate investigation but officials canceled the parade “out of an abundance of caution.”

There has reportedly been no direct threat made against the parade or the governor.

The suspect was described to the outlet as a “rogue individual” in his 50s who liked explosives. He has not yet been identified.

The official told NJ.com that the explosives would not have been able to kill anyone.

The Hill has reached out to the South Plainfield Police Department for comment.
