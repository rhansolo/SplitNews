The New York Times has deleted a tweet saying “airplanes took aim” at the Twin Towers on 9/11 after getting flack for not mentioning that Al Queda terrorists had hijacked the planes that brought down the towers, killing close to 3,000 people.

The original tweet read: “18 years have passed since airplanes took aim and brought down the World Trade Center. Today families will once again gather and grieve at the site where more than 2000 people died.”

But that tweet was quickly scrubbed following a fury on Twitter that continued even after the offending tweet was removed.

“The airplanes didn’t take aim, the Islamic radical hijackers did,” tweeted @jennyjupite.

“How is it that airplanes have not been confiscated already by the government as deadly killers?” @infooverload wondered.

@MattAHay joked: “Wait, so it wasn’t the airplanes who took aim at the buildings? Who was it exactly and why?”

“We’ve deleted an earlier tweet to this story and have edited for clarity,” the Gray Lady posted on the official @NYTimes Twitter account at 8 am. “The story has also been updated,” the paper said, without specifying what changes were made to the story.

The revised tweet now reads: “18 years after nearly 3,000 people were lost, families of those killed in the terror attacks will gather at the 9/11 memorial. There will be a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m., then the names of the dead — one by one — will be recited.”

An NYT spokesperson had not responded.
