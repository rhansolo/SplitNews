A central New Jersey borough called off its Labor Day parade that was supposed to be attended by the governor Monday after a man who lives near the parade route left a cooler full of explosives at a concert Sunday.

Thomas Kaiser, 55, was arrested in connection with “destructive devices” found at his South Plainfield property, close to the start of the 62nd Annual Labor Day Parade, the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement.

Gov. Phil Murphy and first lady Tammy Murphy were scheduled to march in the parade that was set to start at 10 a.m.

Kaiser allegedly brought a cooler of “crude” m-80 firework-like explosive devices to a concert Sunday and left them at Sea Bright bar Donovan’s Reef when he learned he was not allowed to set them off, a police source told The Post.

He also allegedly tried to give one of these “very odd” explosives to a member of the band performing there, Guns 4 Hire, the police source said.

When officials learned that Kaiser lives near the route of the Labor Day Parade, they called it off and raided his house out of an abundance of caution, prosecutors said.

The New Jersey State Police Bomb Unit helped cops to dismantle a half dozen explosive devices allegedly found at Kaiser’s home, the source said.

Kaiser — who was being held by the Sea Bright Police Department — was charged with possession of a destructive device for an unlawful purpose and possession of a destructive device, according to prosecutors who said they anticipated bringing more charges against him.

The man reportedly lives in the basement of his parents home and suffers from mental health issues, according to an NBC report.

Prosecutors said the investigation was ongoing.

It was not immediately known who Kaiser’s lawyer was.
