San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution to declare the National Rifle Association a domestic terrorist organization, while also urging other cities, states and the federal government to ascribe the same label to the gun lobbyist group.

District Two Supervisor Catherine Stefani introduced the resolution after the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting, and she said that incident as well as mass shootings in El Paso and Odessa, Texas, as well as Dayton, Ohio, have bolstered the argument for passing the resolution.

Stefani blamed the NRA for the proliferation of guns in the United States and the mass shootings that have become a near daily occurrence.

“The NRA exists to spread disinformation and knowingly puts weapons in the hands of those who would harm and terrorize us by blocking common-sense gun violence prevention legislation, and by advocating for dangerous legislation like stand-your-ground laws, permit-less carry, and guns in schools from kindergarten on up through university,” Stefani said.

She also called the NRA a misogynist organization because of its stance on arming domestic abusers.

“It is time to rid this country of the NRA and call them out for who they really are: They are a domestic terrorist organization,” Stefani said.

Resolutions are largely symbolic, and often used by the supervisors as a statement of values.

The NRA responded with a statement calling the resolution a “ludicrous stunt,” according to multiple news outlets.

“This ludicrous stunt by the Board of Supervisors is an effort to distract from the real problems facing San Francisco, such as rampant homelessness, drug abuse and skyrocketing petty crime, to name a few,” the statement said. “The NRA will continue working to protect the constitutional rights of all freedom-loving Americans.”
