Washington (CNN) Two Republican members of Congress on Sunday expressed concern over President Donald Trump's now-canceled plan to host Taliban leaders at Camp David for secret peace talks around the 18th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

The comments from Reps. Michael Waltz of Florida and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois come one day after Trump tweeted that he invited Taliban leaders to Camp David for secret peace talks this weekend but canceled the meeting after the Taliban took credit for an attack in Kabul that killed a dozen people, including an American soldier. Trump has long sought to withdraw the US from its longest war, but his revelation on Saturday night that he was considering holding talks with the Taliban at Camp David -- a storied retreat where presidents have famously secured peace accords -- was striking, especially coming so close to the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

"As we head into the anniversary of 9/11, I do not ever want to see these terrorists step foot on United States soil. Period," Waltz, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on "Newsroom" Sunday afternoon.

Waltz said Sunday that among his top concerns over Trump's invitation was the Taliban "declaring this a victory."

"The Taliban have shown zero desire for peace. There's no ceasefire that they've agreed to. In fact, they've ramped up their attacks. We talked about the American soldier that just came home this morning in a coffin," he said.
