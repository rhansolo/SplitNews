In the middle of a deadly pandemic, some leftists are still laser-focused on dividing Americans along racial lines. The entire country has been affected by the novel coronavirus, but some leftists are pushing the narrative that the coronavirus is hurting minority groups to a larger extent than the white population. But while giving an update on Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the current data does not support that narrative.

In California, at least 16,957 people have tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus. The governor says California has examined nearly 40 percent of those cases and the data does not support the theory that minorities are suffering to a greater extent from COVID-19 than the white population. Of the 6,306 positive cases the state investigated, around 30 percent have been identified as Hispanic, 14 percent as Asian, and 6 percent as Black. Of the deaths within those 6,306 cases, around 29 percent have been Hispanic, 16 percent have been Asian, and 3 percent have been Black.

While the governor acknowledged the data accounts for less than 40 percent of the total number of cases in the state, the governor said the findings nevertheless show that coronavirus numbers are roughly tracking the demographics of the state.

What is the purpose of prioritizing this data at this current moment anyway? To demand reparations or other benefits? What if white people end up suffering higher infection rates and deaths?

Surely California has more pressing concerns to which the state can devote its resources.
