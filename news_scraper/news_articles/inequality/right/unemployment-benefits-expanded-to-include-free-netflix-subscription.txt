Unemployment Benefits Expanded To Include Free Netflix Subscription

WASHINGTON, D.C.—The 17th Coronavirus Aid Relief Act passed by the U.S. Congress today expanded benefits to include a free Netflix subscription for those not working.

Anyone on unemployment is now eligible for a full year of Netflix.

"We have to make sure people stay at home as long as possible and not risk them going back to work and growing the economy--er, I mean, spreading the coronavirus," said Nancy Pelosi at a press conference Tuesday. "Anything to keep people home."

Employers have been having trouble getting people back to work, and it's believed this may only exacerbate the problem. The package also includes funding for a free 18-pack of popcorn, a family size bag of Cheetos, and a 12-pack of Surge per unemployed person.

The next aid package will include a free Amazon Prime subscription.
